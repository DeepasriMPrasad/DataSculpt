For dedicated use cases, certain \nexceptions are acceptable, but require good rea -\nsoning and a conscious decision from the respon -\nsible engineering teams. The teams concerned \nneed to both be aware of the long-term conse -\nquences and accept the implications regarding \nany future evolution, roadmap investments, and \ndaily operations. \nThis North Star Architecture document is based on \nthe 2023 SAP strategy paper and complements \nand updates previous North Star Architecture doc-\numents. Its content is based on the alignment work \nof the Cross-Product Architecture  (CPA) working \ngroups.\nThe CPA collaboration model was established in \n2021 to ensure that technology development is \nwell aligned between technology consumers, pri -\nmarily our lines of business (LoBs) and technology \nproviders, which are typically teams within the \nBusiness Technology Platform (BTP) and some -\ntimes service providers from other organizations. \nCPA focuses on improving integration between \nSAP services and standardizing SAP technology \ncomponents where appropriate. The North Star \nArchitecture became an integral part of CPA, as it \nprovides inputs and guardrails that are then \ndetailed out by the various CPA working groups. \nThis document also considers the strategic direc -\ntion from the Cloud Delivery Architecture  (CDA) \ngroup, which was created in 2023 to drive cloud \ndelivery efficiency along the three dimensions of \n“Cloud Delivery Financial Operations”, “Cloud \nDelivery Process and Tools Efficiency” and “Cloud \nDelivery Architecture Optimization”. In addition, \nthis document puts emphasis on achieving various \ncloud qualities and reducing total cost of opera -\ntions (TCO) of our cloud services. The document is \nnot meant to replace the Product Standards , CPA \nworking group documents , or requirements from \nthe Technology Guidelines (TGs).\nThis North Star Architecture document does not \nprovide detailed coverage of all aspects of soft -\nware architecture. It focuses on the architecture \ntopics that are most relevant and impactful for \nSAP in the near and mid-term future. In addition, \ncertain important cross-cutting aspects are not \ndiscussed in dedicated chapters in this document \nbut are addressed across multiple chapters. For \ninstance, security is a core value for SAP and is \nintegral to all our products. Therefore, the concept \nof \"shift left,\" which involves incorporating security \ncapabilities automatically and transparently \nthrough well-defined processes and tools (such as \nhardened images), is discussed in the “ Business \nApplication Development” chapter as an example. \nSimilarly, the topic of asset management is briefly \nmentioned in the “Cloud Delivery and Operations” \nsection. The same approach has been taken for \nother crucial cross-cutting architectural aspects \nlike reliability and resiliency.\nIn the following nine chapters, which are struc -\ntured into overarching topic areas, this document \ndescribes SAP’s strategic direction.\nThe North Star Architecture document gives guidance for the most strategic \narchitectural topics at SAP. It provides technical recommendations, engineering \nprinciples, architecture guardrails, and best practices for applications and \nservices, addressing a time horizon of three to five years.\nIntroduction\n\nPage 4:\n2 | 21\nNorth Star Architecture Strategy 2024\nINTERNAL – SAP  Only\nOur goal is to enable all SAP products to contribute to a seamless \nuser experience that provides value to our customers by being integrated, \nconsistent, intuitive, insight-driven, and is implemented in a cost-efficient way. \nTo realize this, we must deeply understand the \nuser’s needs. Only then can we design and develop \nthe right user experience that will excite customers \nand makes SAP attractive and competitive in the \nmarket. The user experience of our products must \nalso become more tailored to role-based use cases \nand offer personalization for end user needs.\nTo deliver on this goal, all products must comply \nwith the existing product standards, most promi -\nnently Product Standard UX Consistency (UXC) and \nProduct Standard Accessibility. Furthermore, devel-\nopment teams need to consider the following strat-\negies and guidance:\n • ONE Design System: We must further harmonize \napplication design while providing an inclusive, \ncustomer-first approach to designing and devel -\noping at SAP. The SAP Design System is SAP’s \n unified design system. All web and mobile appli-\ncations across our product portfolio must adopt \nthese concepts and adhere to them to ease the \noverall implementation and foster out-of-the-box \nconsistency (see enablement guide). Established \ndesign guidelines such as Fiori Design Guidelines \nfor Web and BTP UX Toolkit are already built on \ncornerstones like UXC and are being consoli -\ndated into a single SAP Design System Portal to \nprovide guidance for components, patterns, floor-\nplans and even CLI. To enhance and broaden our \nSAP Design System, we are transitioning to an \nInnerSource contribution model across all prod -\nucts managed by Core Design.\n • UI Component Strategy: To enhance UX consis-\ntency across applications, we are further harmo -\nnizing a growing list of technology agnostic \n commonly used components. Accordingly, we are \nextending our UI Technology strategy by offering \nUser Experience\nSAP Web Components for general reuse across \ndifferent UI technologies (e.g., SAPUI5, React, and \nAngular), improving developer efficiency and \nensuring consistent enterprise qualities. Lastly, \nthe creation and contribution of domain-specific \nweb components will be further streamlined \nthrough the Hyperspace Paved Road for SAP \nWeb Components.\n • User Insights: To measure success, product \nteams must collect user insights through a UI con-\ntext-aware Product Experience (PX) Integration \n(TG17 – User Insights ) by embedding standard -\nized Qualtrics surveys. Improvements can also be \nanalyzed with the BTP UX Deep-Dive Dashboard \n(T&I) and the Voice of the User Dashboard (PE).\n • Mobile Experience and Mobile  Technologies: \nMobile applications must be built with SAP Mobile \nTechnologies (e.g., SDK, MDK) using Mobile ser -\nvices ( TG44 – Mobile Technologies ). With these \ntechnologies, SAP, customers, and partners can \nfind clear guidance on how to rapidly build enter-\nprise-grade mobile solutions. Mobile applications \nmust also follow SAP’s mobile design guidelines.\n • Digital Assistant (Joule): For the conversational \nexperience SAP’s Digital Assistant (Joule) must \nbe embedded throughout SAP’s cloud portfolio, \ndelivering contextualized insights. AI UX guidance \nis constantly growing as we learn and iterate. \nWe are building an integrated platform experi -\nence fueled by SAP Kernel Services  to provide \nconsistent access to the same functionality across \nall SAP products, following platform experience \ndesign guidelines. Every product must integrate \nwith these services to enable a common set of UX-\nrelated capabilities.\n\nPage 5:\n3 | 21\nNorth Star Architecture Strategy 2024\nINTERNAL – SAP  Only\nUser Experience\nOur end users often rely on various products and \napplications during the execution of their business \nprocesses. To ensure the best possible support for \nour users, all products for business users must inte-\ngrate with SAP’s central entry points  ( TG01 – \n Central Entry Point and Cross Product Navigation), \ni.e., SAP Start or SAP Build Work Zone editions. \nThese provide simple and intuitive access to appli-\ncations, tasks, processes, and information across \nall SAP products through one underlying common \nplatform. To enable central entry points, products \nmust integrate with kernel services like SAP Build \nWork Zone foundation:\n • Deep Linking: Deep linking capabilities enable \ncross-product navigation. Products must support \ndeep linking (TG01.R1 – Support Deep Linking) to \nallow direct navigation from central entry points \nor product entry points.\n • Content Integration: Products must evolve to \nbecome content providers ( TG01.R2 – Integrate \nwith Central Entry Point) by utilizing the Common \nData Model Replication API to allow for content \naggregation in business users’ central entry \npoints. Essential integration content like business \napplications and deep links are shared via the \nWork Zone platform while assuring a product’s \ntechnical autonomy.\n • Interest Cards: Integrating with the Interest Card \nService ( TG01.R4  – Integrate with Interest Card \nService) allows SAP business solutions to provide \nconsistent, up-to-date information to their busi -\nness users through SAP’s central entry point \nsolutions.\n • Tasks: Kernel service SAP Task Center ( TG13 – \nOne Inbox) provides a single task inbox for web \nand mobile that enables customers to process \ntasks in a streamlined manner.\n • Notifications: Integrating with Notifications  Kernel \nService allows products to make users aware about \nsituations that require timely action or attention. \nNotifications are delivered over various channels – \nweb app, mobile, email, messaging apps, etc. \nTo stay competitive and optimize R&D costs, SAP \nconstantly enhances its UX platform capabilities. \nFurther steps in that direction include the harmo -\nnization of user settings, standardizing themes, \nand centralizing navigation.\nIn addition to enhancing the business user experi -\nence, we put high emphasis on optimizing the user \nexperience for administrators and developers:\nThe journey for administrators begins with their first \ninteraction as potential customers. We’re refining \nthe user experience from the moment customers \ninitiate their first SAP solution rollout, including trial \nor freemium offerings, up to the complete lifecycle- \nand landscape management for all their SAP solu -\ntions. We envision a SaaS user experience that \nempowers customers to focus on their businesses \nrather than on IT infrastructure management. \nThrough holistic landscape management, we intend \nto help customers maximize the value of their SAP \nsolution. Customers will be able to manage all their \nSAP solutions as part of their entire IT landscape, \nwhether they prefer an interactive user interface, a \ncommand line interface, or automation tooling for \nthis purpose. More insights about our technical \napproach can be found in the chapters on \n Integration and Business Technology Platform.\nTransitioning to developers, we understand that UX \ntranscends beyond graphical user interfaces and \ncovers the entire interaction framework. To fuel \ninnovation and evolution in solutions, it is impera -\ntive to provide a consistent and harmonized API \necosystem around our products. This requires a \ndeeper exploration beyond fundamental API pat -\nterns and general concepts for our APIs across all \nSAP solutions (TG03 – Aligned Business APIs). We \nmust design these APIs with both a service provider \nmindset and a focus on our consumers’ use cases. \nWe’re further witnessing a change from command-\nbased interaction to intent-based outcome specifi-\ncations. The interface design needs to empower \ndevelopers to state their outcome (conversational/\nprompts) rather than navigate complex options.\n\nPage 6:\n4 | 21\nNorth Star Architecture Strategy 2024\nINTERNAL – SAP  Only\nWhile we are committed to providing an open, extensible, and heterogeneous \necosystem of tools and services to internal and external developers, we need to \nimprove developer efficiency through harmonization, consolidation, and more \nguidance. \nA major cornerstone of SAP’s success was the abil-\nity to provide a coherent development platform \nfor building business applications in a highly cost \nand time-efficient way. Business application devel-\nopers were able to focus solely on solving busi -\nness-related problems by writing business logic \nrather than being sidetracked by the need to \ndecide among and integrate with a wide range of \ndifferent technical and infrastructure services and \nframeworks. \nThe primary measures of efficiency are the total \ncost of research and development (TCD) and the \ntotal cost of (cloud) operations (TCO). TCD encom-\npasses all costs related to the design and devel -\nopment of the software, including design, imple -\nmentation, testing, and bug fixing. TCO includes \nthe cost for operating and supporting the applica -\ntion. It also refers to efforts for customers to imple-\nment and operate a solution. Development teams \nneed to optimize for both by adhering to the fol -\nlowing guidance:\n • Reduce the overall heterogeneity and \n complexity of technology stacks within SAP. \nThis internal harmonization will help us optimize \ncosts by reducing redundant development and \nmaintenance efforts. Instead, all development \nteams need to proactively seek more reuse. Less \nvariation and more focus will also foster \ninnovation.\n • Expedite the adoption of central services  (by \nimplementing Technology Guidelines ). Kernel \nServices, Unified Services , and others provide \nstandardization, drive reuse, and facilitate seam -\nless and uniform application integration. They \ncontribute to meeting our TCO targets and our \noverall quality criteria by having specialized \nteams focusing on cloud qualities and product \nstandard compliance. Central services consis -\ntently provide reusable, high-quality capabilities \nto all business applications. The services relieve \napplication developers of solving technical \nproblems beyond specific business require -\nments. Apart from a technical scope, Unified Ser-\nvices also cover aspects such as commerciali -\nzation. They facilitate the move from a \nsub scription-based to a consumption-based \ncommercial model (as described in the Commit-\nto-Consume strategy), which typically requires \nsignificant architectural changes. Unified Ser -\nvices (e.g., Unified Account) centrally provide a \nflexible and solid foundation so that future \nchanges of commercial aspects have fewer \nimplications for application and service provid -\ners. This foundation will also be an important \nenabler for an open SAP partner ecosystem by \nreducing the technical integration effort on the \npartner side.\n • Use SAP’s opinionated development models \ntailored to business application developers.  \nDevelopers should focus on business logic \nrather than on boilerplate activities and code. \nDevelopment models such as the SAP Cloud \nApplication Programming Model (CAP) and \nABAP Cloud, comprising the ABAP RESTful \n Application Programming Model (RAP), are the \ndefault choice for application teams.\n • Adopt standard development processes. SAP \nHyperspace offers a standard process frame -\nwork for developing and delivering compliant, \nsecure, and high-quality enterprise software. \nThe provided templates and tools, such as \nBusiness Application Development\n\nPage 7:\n5 | 21\nNorth Star Architecture Strategy 2024\nINTERNAL – SAP  Only\npreconfigured and secure CI/CD pipelines, \nGolden Images, Cloud Native Buildpacks, etc. \nenable developers to focus on core develop -\nment tasks rather than “reinventing” custom pro -\ncesses and tools. Hyperspace also provides \nPaved Roads, which compile best practices and \nprovide guidance that can be leveraged by \ndevelopers through the Hyperspace Portal to \nensure secure-by-default SAP Cloud products \nand deployments to the cloud.\n • Follow best practices and prescribed \ndefaults. The Golden Path (internal)  and the \nBTP Developer’s Guide (external), both driven by \nthe CPA WG “Cloud Development”  and aligned \nacross other related WGs, provide the go-to \narchitecture for the majority of BTP-based busi -\nness applications. The Golden Path contains an \narchitecture blueprint with a curated list of ser -\nvices to integrate with, provides guidance for \nsoftware development and delivery processes, \nand gives instructions on how to deliver on cloud \nqualities and Intelligent Enterprise Suite Quali -\nties. It is equally important to follow the guid -\nance on Optimizing Cost for Cloud Development \nand Operations. This guide provides an overview \nof basic principles for reducing costs by making \nTCO a primary architecture and decision driver \nthroughout the whole development process. As \nwe can only optimize what we can measure, \nmore data points and insights will be needed to \nmonitor and drive cost optimization. While teams \ncan already address this today by implementing \nTCO-tailored logging and metering, a regular \nanalysis of their workload, and a proactive moni -\ntoring of resource utilization, we aim to also pro -\nvide more central support through, e.g., cost \noptimization dashboards, etc. The integration of \nAI capabilities into our development tools will \nalso help drive the implicit adoption of develop -\nment best practices and defaults.\n • Support collaborative development by apply-\ning Open Source ( SAP Open Source Manifesto ) \nand InnerSource. Establishing InnerSource, which \nis the application of methodologies and best \npractices from open-source communities to in-\nhouse software development, will improve devel-\nopment efficiency and productivity. It also  fosters \nreuse and reduces redundant development \nbecause teams can influence/extend reuse \n components with their own contributions.\nBusiness Application Development\n\nPage 8:\n6 | 21\nNorth Star Architecture Strategy 2024\nINTERNAL – SAP  Only\nIt also aims to provide capabilities to integrate with \nthird-party solutions so they can bring their data \ninto the SAP data landscape, as well as giving them \nthe ability to consume SAP data products while \ncomplying with data protection and privacy laws. \nSAP’s data architecture is based around a set of \napplications needed to collect, manage, store, \nand process data. For more information, see “Data \nPlatform – Architecture“.\nWith regard to data persistence, SAP HANA Cloud \nforms the core of our data architecture. It has \nexpanded beyond the original in-memory data -\nbase to include data on disk and data persisted in \nlow-cost cloud object stores. HANA Cloud and \nHANA Cloud Data Lake instances can be deployed \ntogether or separately by LoBs when and where \nneeded. With the focus on multi-tenancy, cost \nreductions, and scalability, HANA Cloud must be \nthe default database, not just for all new cloud \napplications for transaction processing and ana -\nlytics, but also for decomposed (micro) services \nas outlined in an ADR for HANA Cloud . In addition \nto new applications, it is expected that cloud \napplications running on HANA 2.0 on-prem ver -\nsion should migrate to HANA Cloud. What’s more, \nin many (but not all) cases, existing applications \nrunning on third-party databases will benefit from \nmoving to HANA Cloud as outlined in the HANA \nCloud ADR. HANA Cloud Data Lake also provides \na low-cost and scalable data lake storage that can \nbe accessed directly from HANA Cloud via both \nfederation and replication.\nOn the compute front, Spark Compute  is to be \nleveraged for scalable, powerful data engineering \nand AI, operating against data in the HANA Cloud \nData Lake. Spark jobs are used to cleanse, refine, \nand derive data, producing Data Products  that are \ndesigned for consumption. SAP has partnered \nwith Databricks to use their managed Spark ser -\nvice, tightly integrated with the HANA Cloud Data \nLake, with all data persisted in the HANA Cloud \nData Lake. To mitigate the risk of being fully depen-\ndent on third-party technology, an in-house-  \nmanaged Spark service has been built in parallel \nas part of SAP HANA Cloud. The HANA Cloud \nSpark service is initially only being used in the Pro-\ncurement data platform but is expected to extend \nto other use cases in the future.\nSAP Datasphere  (formerly known as Data Ware -\nhouse Cloud with additional data integration fea -\ntures) provides data mart capabilities in support \nof analytics (including cross application) and cus -\ntom data modeling. It also provides data integra -\ntion tools that can be used in conjunction with or \nindependently of the data mart. Datasphere is \nbeing enhanced to provide simple consumption of \nData Products, as well as the ability to publish \nderived Data Products.\nFor data visualization and planning, SAP  Analytics \nCloud (SAC) is the strategic technology choice for \nboth standalone and embedded analytics, see \nTG32. SAC OEM (the embedded version, for \nembedding in SAP applications), is being enhanced \nwith a lightweight viewer to improve performance \nand a shared application tenant to reduce cost. \nFiori/UI5 controls are also a lightweight low-cost \noption for embedding individual analytic controls \nin an application.\nFor distributed data platform architecture, Data \nProducts are the cornerstone, as they enable \nsharing data across domains and application \nboundaries. SAP applications, as well as customer \nand partner applications, can easily publish the \nOur vision is to standardize on a common data architecture that centers on \nenabling LoBs, customers, and partners to easily produce and consume data \nacross application boundaries. \nData Management\n\nPage 9:\n7 | 21\nNorth Star Architecture Strategy 2024\nINTERNAL – SAP  Only\nmetadata describing available Data Products via \nOpen Resource Discovery  (ORD). As the ORD \naggregator, Unified Customer Landscape (UCL) \nwill serve as a Data Products Directory, enabling \napplications and users to both find and discover \nData Products and access the metadata needed \nto consume and understand them in a standard -\nized manner. The Datasphere Catalog will inte -\ngrate with UCL to facilitate consumption and inte -\ngration of Data Products in Datasphere models. \nSAP Business Accelerator Hub will add support \nfor Data Products as a resource type, showing all \nData Products available from SAP applications.\nThe Data Product concept is taken from data mesh \narchitectures, where each domain exposes data \nproducts that others can consume. Data Products \nare data sets that are exposed for consumption via \nan API and enriched by metadata in form of an \nORD document describing the data product and \nindicating where and how it can be accessed. Data \nProducts can be exposed directly from either an \napplication, a HANA Cloud instance, a HANA Data \nLake, or a Datasphere tenant. Moving forward, the \nstrategy is to expose all relevant data needed for \nboth data processing and analytics as Data \nProducts.\nCustomers and SAP also need to be able to com -\nbine data from different applications. To do this, \ntwo things are needed – the ability to uniquely \nidentify business objects in their system land -\nscape and the ability to map the data semantics of \none application to those of another. For the for -\nmer, applications need to expose data with ODM \nIDs (OIDs) and for the latter, applications need to \nexpose data that complies with the ODM 2.0 rules \nand guidelines . Instead of creating only new \naligned integration models, ODM 2.0 is designed \nto extend existing APIs, Events, and Data Products. \nODM enables additional metadata to interconnect \ndata from various applications semantically. In due \ncourse, most business objects exposed by Data \nProducts are expected to be ODM compliant.\nBecause the data is accessed for business trans -\nactions or analytics, it is important to ensure that \nSAP complies with the local data protection and \nprivacy laws. As more countries recognize the \nimportance of mature and secure Data Privacy \nand Protection  (DPP) legislation to ensure their \nsovereignty, covering the increasing complexity of \nthe different country-specific DPP requirements \nand legislation is expected to become more chal -\nlenging in the future. Our aim is to provide the high-\nest standards for DPP across all SAP products and \nprovide a single access point to customers for DPP \ninformation requests or information data access \nreports for all products. The goal is to integrate \nLoB-specific DPP solutions with the Data  Privacy \nIntegration Kernel Service in a federated approach \nfor the creation, processing, transfer, and destruc -\ntion of personal data across application boundar -\nies. For more details on data processing based on \npurpose, refer to the vision of the Working Group \n“Data Protection and Privacy”.\nIn addition, it is important that all data manage -\nment stores be able to use customer-specific \nencryption keys to encrypt relevant data at rest. \nAll applications and services must adopt these \ncapabilities. Customers may also opt in to manage \ntheir encryption keys. The central key manage -\nment will be enabled through a kernel service that \nintegrates internally with SAP’s Data Custodian \nKey Management Service for the customer-  \nmanaged-keys scenario.\nData Management\n\nPage 10:\n8 | 21\nNorth Star Architecture Strategy 2024\nINTERNAL – SAP  Only\nAs of mid-2023, SAP developed more than \n130 embedded AI scenarios. SAP projects can be \ngenerally categorized into the following AI capabili-\nties: machine learning (ML), natural language pro -\ncessing (NLP), conversational AI, computer vision, \nand semantic technologies. SAP’s vision is to infuse \nGenAI-powered innovations across all cloud busi -\nness applications and BTP, embed SAP’s Digital \nAssistant (Joule) in all products, and build SAP-spe-\ncific foundational models. Generative AI capabili -\nties will be offered to our partners and customers \nto build and extend applications. For this purpose, \nwe will provide enterprise-grade qualities, includ -\ning data privacy and security. We will also support \nthe flexibility to adapt to the continuous emergence \nof new use cases and the ongoing evolution of \nGenAI technology.\nFor the conversational experience, SAP’s Digital \nAssistant (Joule) will be embedded throughout \nSAP’s cloud enterprise portfolio, delivering proac -\ntive and contextualized insights from across the \nbreadth and depth of SAP solutions and third-party \nsources. When building conversational capabilities \nfor our business software, we strongly recommend \nintegrating with Joule rather than starting from \nscratch and/or leverage third-party solutions.\nThe large language model (LLM) market is highly \ndynamic, and as new vendors enter the market and \nopen-source models become competitive, costs \nare likely to go down and models will specialize. \nTherefore, SAP will centrally contract, validate, and \nprovide access to LLMs from multiple vendors and \ntake care of many non-functional aspects such as \nsecurity or metering. For this, a generative AI hub \nin AI Core will be provided to SAP business applica-\ntions along with SAP tooling for infrastructure and \nsoftware development (e.g., code generation). LoBs \nshould use the generative AI hub to access \nprovided LLMs. For more information, refer to “Large \nLanguage Model Access at SAP”.\nLLMs come with a significant amount of knowledge, \nbut they do not contain information beyond the \noriginal training data set, such as SAP-specific infor-\nmation or customer-specific information that might \nbe relevant for a use case. To address this limita -\ntion, business data, semantics, and metadata need \nto be incorporated into an LLM request to ground \nthe LLM. To that end, the generative AI hub will pro-\nvide capabilities to integrate with SAP’s data plat -\nform. On top of that, SAP HANA Cloud will provide a \nvector database capability for storing embeddings \nand conducting efficient similarity searches. SAP \nwill adapt LLMs to its context and create its own dif-\nferentiated foundation model that incorporates \nstructured data and business process knowledge \nwith GPT/4HANA. In addition, KG/4HANA  will pro -\nvide semantic context (e.g., via Knowledge Graphs) \nto enable natural-language-based access and \nknowledge-driven exploration of SAP data, as well \nas to scale the training of foundation models.\nSAP is committed to trustworthy and responsi -\nble AI, adhering to a rigorous AI Ethics policy that is \nbinding for all employees. The policy is continu -\nously updated in line with the UNESCO’s AI Ethics \nrecommendations. It is recommended that the \nAI  Ethics Assessment Process be followed while \nbuilding use cases with AI features and functional -\nity. Prioritizing data protection and privacy, SAP \nimplements measures such as partner agreements \nand legal intake processes and uses SAP-hosted \nmodels. Security in AI is emphasized through edu -\ncation programs and countermeasures against \nthreats like data tampering and AI hallucinations. \nSAP is also investing in Explainable AI (XAI) to boost \ntrust and security by making AI-generated outputs \ntransparent.\nRecent breakthroughs in generative AI (GenAI) have created  \nnew opportunities that go far beyond what has been possible until today.\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nPage 11:\n9 | 21\nNorth Star Architecture Strategy 2024\nINTERNAL – SAP  Only\nFor more information on SAP strategy on Genera -\ntive AI, refer to the Generative AI Technology \n Strategy Whitepaper. More guidance for engineer -\ning teams developing LLM use cases can be found \nat the CPA Working Group “AI”.\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nPage 12:\n10 | 21\nNorth Star Architecture Strategy 2024\nINTERNAL – SAP  Only\nThe current reality is that we are still selling indi -\nvidual applications and services that differ signifi -\ncantly in product experiences – e.g., with respect \nto provisioning, integration, and configuration. \nMost of the integration efforts are still offloaded to \nthe customer. We need to address this by putting \nan even stronger focus on enabling a consistent \nSaaS-like experience instead of forcing customers \ninto a PaaS-like (platform as a service) experience, \nasking them to create and manage the technical \nwiring between our applications (creating and \nmaintaining service instances, copying creden -\ntials, etc.) on their own.\nThe foundation for delivering a cloud-like integra -\ntion experience is to clearly separate technical and \nbusiness integration (see Beyond Zones). Techni-\ncal integration refers to all tasks related to setting \nup the technical wiring between applications and/\nor services. This includes establishing trust (e.g., \nby setting up mutual TLS or OAuth-based authen ti-\ncation), the provisioning of integration services (e.g., \nKernel Services) or the application-specific config-\nuration of connections. Business integration, on the \nother hand, refers to all business-related integra -\ntion decisions that the customer makes and mani -\nfests by configuring such a business integration, \nspecifying the intent that different applications (or \ntenants to be more specific) be integrated with each \nother. These business integration decisions are fully \nmanaged by the customer (customer-managed) as \nthey provide the needed flexibility for customers to \nconfigure their business processes. All the required \nunderlying technical integrations, on the other hand, \nneed to be handled automatically by SAP, without \nthe customer even noticing (SAP-managed).\nTaking this even further, we need to deliver smart \nintegration defaults and out-of-the-box automa -\ntion wherever possible. For business integrations, \nthis means that customers get proposals that \nmatch their business intent and landscape setup. \nPreferably, these proposals are provided as part \nof a central UI that facilitates provisioning, integra -\ntion, and configuration in a harmonized experi -\nence. Customers can follow our proposals or \nadjust them to their specific needs. A thorough \nunderstanding of the as-is landscape (provided \nvia landscape introspection capabilities) and \narchitecture templates that model landscape \noptions (provided via architecture blueprints) form \nthe technical basis for smart defaults and the \nunderlying technical automation. Architecture \nblueprints can be seen as executable reference \narchitectures that describe how applications and \nservices are combined into business solutions. \nThey are complemented with information about \nthe current landscape and are enriched with cus -\ntomer input where required. The required land -\nscape data is provided through Unified Landscape \nIntrospection (ULI) capabilities and is retrieved \nfrom different source such as the Cloud Land -\nscape Directory (CLD), Unified Customer Land -\nscape (UCL), or Open Resource Discovery  (ORD) \nfor data on APIs and Events. The resulting solution \nblueprint is the basis for a declarative description \nof the target landscape, the so-called desired \nstate.\nMany of the capabilities mentioned above (the \nseparation of customer-managed business and \nSAP-managed technical integrations, automation \nbased on blueprints, etc.) are facilitated by the \nUnified Services (Unified Provisioning, Unified \nOffering a seamlessly integrated suite of products to our customers remains one \nof our most important strategic aspirations and SAP’s unique selling proposition. \nIt is a fundamental prerequisite for being able to offer end-to-end business \nprocesses and elevate cross-sell opportunities. \nIntegration\n\nPage 13:\n11 | 21\nNorth Star Architecture Strategy 2024\nINTERNAL – SAP  Only\nAccount, Unified Customer Landscape etc.). They \nprovide an LoB-agnostic set of services that eases \nthe integration of applications and services both \nwithin SAP and for partner solutions. Unified Ser -\nvices allow service providers to centrally register \ntheir services as resources in a central repository \nto be consumed by others – independent of where \nand how the services are built. Depending on the \nneeds of the provider, not only can Unified Ser -\nvices be used to orchestrate provisioning and inte-\ngration, they can also address concerns like com -\nmercialization or metering. It should be noted that \nthe objective is not to rip and replace existing \ntools and services but to provide a central control \nplane that glues together the puzzle pieces into a \ncoherent view. Inspired by Kubernetes, Unified \nServices try to achieve this by implementing an \noperator pattern, observing declarative requests \n(the desired state), and acting to fulfill them (the \nactual state). Instead of configuring technical \ndetails imperatively on each singular customer \nsystem, customers will be able to declare changes \nto their systems at an abstract level that reflects \ntheir business needs, while the required technical \nand configuration changes will be automated and \nmanaged by SAP and/or partners.\nApart from streamlining the setup of integrations, we \nalso strive for more guidance and best practices as \nto which patterns should be used to develop inte -\ngrations across applications. Concrete use cases for \nintegrations include, for example, data distribution, \nprocess integration, and side-by-side process \nextensions. We aim to provide more guardrails for \nall cases as to which patterns (e.g., request-driven \nvs. event-driven) and technology should be used by \nthe development teams at SAP. As an example, for \nmaster data we have an aligned target architecture \nconsisting of Master Data Integration (MDI) as the \nservice for replication, entity services as reuse ser-\nvices, and the data architecture for analytical master \ndata consumption.\nFor services that are shared across different appli-\ncation tenants, for example, MDI, Event Broker, Cen-\ntral Entry Point (CEP), Task Center etc., semantics \nand behavior of the tenant IDs currently need to be \naligned with the involved applications, leading to \ninconsistencies, duplicate efforts, and disruption of \nintegration flows in case tenants are moved from \none data center to another. To overcome this, Global \nTenant ID (GTID) must be adopted as a common, \nstable, and unique way to identify the tenants.\nIntegration\n\nPage 14:\n12 | 21\nNorth Star Architecture Strategy 2024\nINTERNAL – SAP  Only\nSAP BTP consists of services, runtimes, and capa -\nbilities that are contributed by various organizations \nin SAP. Detailed information about the foundational \ntopics and technologies on SAP BTP’s way forward \nduring the next five years can be found in the 2023 \nBTP Foundation Technology Strategy paper.\nBTP is moving towards a service-centric \napproach, and we bundle these services for cus -\ntomer-facing offerings. To provide the core capa -\nbilities of an ecosystem, BTP – as the foundation \nof SAP’s Business SaaS offerings – is transforming \nfrom the current runtime-centric approach toward \na multi-cloud, service-centric, and open ecosys -\ntem. All BTP capabilities will be consumable inde -\npendent of the runtime used. We will also remove \ndependencies on specific implementation details \nof BTP services to reduce the architectural com -\nplexity. By eliminating the need for service con -\nsumers to comply with such implementation spe -\ncifics of BTP-provided services, we will reduce the \ncurrent strong coupling among BTP services and \ntheir consumers. That way we will be able to drive \nthe evolution of BTP more efficiently and to adapt \nto changing requirements faster. Consumers will \nalso have more flexibility both when they are \nbuilding solutions on top of BTP, and when they \nare just consuming individual services.\nBTP currently acts as a virtual technical platform \nprovider across different hyperscalers and will be \navailable on SAP Converged Cloud in SAP data \ncenters as well. By means of Unified Services , SAP \nBTP is also extending its capabilities toward pro -\nviding a seamless integration into a harmonized, \nyet flexible commercial and operational frame -\nwork. BTP can then be used more flexibly by any \nsolution as the platform to integrate into the SAP \necosystem. It enables developers to leverage all \nenterprise-grade BTP services, without the need \nto adapt the solution architecture to the technical \nconcepts of BTP. In addition, BTP provides the \noption to leverage hyperscaler or third-party ser -\nvices. This provides a high degree of flexibility to \nsupport evolutionary changes and quick time-to-\nmarket options for applications and services. We \navoid the need for short-term implementations of \nnew and sometimes immature platform features, \nwhich increase the risk of weakening the overall \nenterprise qualities of BTP itself. In case of an \nincreasing demand, we still have the option to \nimplement requested new capabilities on BTP at a \nlater point in time. Thus, we can ensure that all SAP \nquality criteria and the right level of maturity are \nmet. For SAP application and service develop -\nment teams, more guidance can be found in  \n Working with Hyperscalers and PlusOne .\nEnhancing the overall customer experience for \nfully integrated business solutions when leverag -\ning multiple SAP solutions is part of the overall \nSAP strategy. An essential part is providing a seam-\nless SaaS experience for our customers – both \nwithin our own portfolio and with partner solu -\ntions. In addition to direct application-to-applica -\ntion integration, BTP also supports the Integration \nfor SaaS scenario, where selected BTP services \nprovide integration technologies (Master Data \nIntegration, Event Broker, Task Center, etc.) for SAP \napplications (see chapter “Integrations”).\nWe are also harmonizing the various concepts and \ntechnologies that are currently used within SAP for \ntenant provisioning and integration management. \nThe SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) provides the technical foundation \nfor our LoBs, customers, and partners. It is mission critical to SAP’s strategy as \ndocumented in SAP’s Corporate Strategy 2023 paper. One of SAP’s strategic \npriorities is to “Make our SAP BTP the platform for SAP and our ecosystem.”\nBusiness Technology Platform\n\nPage 15:\n13 | 21\nNorth Star Architecture Strategy 2024\nINTERNAL – SAP  Only\nBusiness Technology Platform\nThe goal is one holistic but flexible approach. The \nexisting BTP-specific subscription management \nalso evolves towards this one harmonized \napproach. The target state is to provide technical \nservices and capabilities to holistically manage \napplication tenants and all related integrations \nduring their complete lifecycle and across all SAP \nproducts and partner solutions, regardless of \nwhether these solutions are based on a BTP run -\ntime or not. These capabilities are based on the \nfundamental architectural concepts of the Unified \nServices as described in the “ Integrations” chap -\nter. Consequently, we need to smoothly evolve the \nBTP multi-tenancy approach and untangle vari-\nous orthogonal aspects (tenant, region, trust, secu-\nrity, commercial, etc.) that are currently tightly cou-\npled to the concept of a local BTP subaccount.\nIn parallel to the automated provisioning and inte -\ngration lifecycle management, the appropriate level \nof control is provided to customers, allowing them \nto adapt the configuration to their business-specific \nneeds. This approach allows SAP customers to \nfocus on their core business operations while we \nhandle the technical aspects of their applications \nand integration. We ensure flexibility without the \nneed for customers to understand or work with BTP \nPaaS concepts like subaccounts or runtimes when \nthey are configuring and managing their SAP solu -\ntions and the related integrations. This harmoniza -\ntion also strives to deliver automated orchestration \nof the customer system landscape and the \nrelated integrations. At any time, customers will \nbe able to get an overview of their actual land -\nscape, including BTP-based applications, BTP-\nexternal LoB solutions, connected on-prem solu -\ntions, partner solutions, registered third-party \nsystems, and the related integrations. All landscape \ninformation will be accessible via the Unified Land-\nscape Introspection based on Unified Metadata \nService (UMS) as machine-readable data, so that \napplications can smartly react to changes and \nextensions of the customer’s system landscape.\nA vibrant partner ecosystem around SAP’s cloud \nofferings has been desired for a long time. With \nUnified Services being part of BTP, we will provide \nthe technical foundation for an open SAP ecosys -\ntem. Functionality like seamless integration into \nthe SAP marketplace or leveraging fully managed \nmetering and billing infrastructure will not only be \navailable SAP internally, it will also be offered to \npartners to build a vital and growing ecosystem \naround SAP’s core business solutions. For part -\nners and independent software vendors (ISVs), we \nwill lower the entry barrier by providing more guid-\nance, frameworks, and tools. Partners and ISVs \nwill be able to offer and monetize their solutions \non the SAP marketplace, regardless of whether \ntheir solutions are built on a BTP runtime or not.\nWe are also untangling the cloud services manage-\nment, including account and subscription manage-\nment, provisioning, integration management, meter-\ning, and commercialization from the core BTP PaaS \ncapabilities and providing them as decoupled \n Unified Services. This allows all non-BTP SAP appli-\ncations and partner solutions to leverage them as \nwell. When fully leveraging BTP as the platform for \ndeveloping and hosting a business solution, inte -\ngration into the SAP ecosystem is provided out-of-\nthe-box without any additional effort. Business \nsolutions that do not use BTP PaaS capabilities can \nstill benefit from BTP by consuming any of the BTP-\nprovided services. All business solutions must \nadopt Unified Services to be seamlessly integrated \ninto the SAP ecosystem and made available to cus-\ntomers through the SAP Marketplace.\nBTP provides all its PaaS capabilities in the form \nof enterprise-grade services and qualities that are \nunderpinning the Golden Path guidance to increase \nthe efficiency of SAP developers. These PaaS enter-\nprise-grade capabilities include connectivity, inte -\ngration, reliability, scalability, compliance, security, \noperational aspects, and multi-cloud abstraction. \nTo further improve the overall platform experience \nand developer efficiency, customer-facing APIs are \nconstantly being enhanced and the automation \ncapabilities are being extended.\nSAP’s solutions offer dependable audits and com-\npliance checks, covering various national and inter-\nnational standards related to information security\n\nPage 16:\n14 | 21\nNorth Star Architecture Strategy 2024\nINTERNAL – SAP  Only\nBusiness Technology Platform\nand data protection. For this data protection and \nprivacy (DPP) aspect, BTP also caters to special \nrequirements such as “EU Access Only” for sensi -\ntive industries as part of these PaaS capabilities.\nWe are introducing capabilities in BTP that enable \nit to be run in Private and Sovereign Clouds.  \nThis expands our business opportunities, as it \nallows customers to run BTP workloads in their \nown data centers or dedicated data centers to ful-\nfill specific regulatory and/or legal requirements. \nWe also support “air-gapped” environments where \ndedicated operators handle SRE (Site Reliability \nEngineering) responsibilities. Technologically, \n Gardener and IronCore (aka “Gardener on Metal”) \nwill support these distributed environments with a \nconsistent approach to infrastructure manage -\nment. However, there will also be changes to pro -\ncesses, operational models, software delivery, \ncloud services management, and core platform \nservices to accommodate Private Cloud.\n\nPage 17:\n15 | 21\nNorth Star Architecture Strategy 2024\nINTERNAL – SAP  Only\nDeployments of cloud solutions are preferably \nlocated in consolidated locations to avoid complex-\nity in operations and support. Aligned placement of \ndeployments across the entire SAP portfolio is \ntherefore required to support the best experience \nfor customers, maximize business value, and to opti-\nmize our delivery efficiency and TCO.\nIn addition, consumption of each service either \nlocally in each infrastructure region (CAT-1), or \ncross consumption across infrastructure once per \nregion (CAT-2), or once globally (CAT-3) is deter -\nmined via a categorization  based on technical, \nlegal, and regulatory aspects like data residency \nrequirements. It’s important that services that are \noffered for cross-consumption be remotely acces-\nsible from any infrastructure region, especially the \nCAT-2 and CAT-3 services. This includes, but is not \nlimited to, decoupling from the current BTP subac-\ncount, ensuring that the service supports authenti -\ncation with SSO, integrated audit logs, ready-to-\nuse tenant setups, compliance with regulatory \nrequirements, etc.\nTo react faster to growing customer demands, SAP \nalso needs to provide more flexibility regarding \nthe presence of our products (including BTP) in \nnew regions and markets. For BTP and its related \nservices, this is planned to be achieved via \n satellites and ground stations. Ground stations are \ninfrastructure regions with a CloudFoundry land -\nscape and a BTP Region local control plane. Satel-\nlites are a group of services deployed into an infra-\nstructure region where no BTP ground station is \npresent. With this approach, we expect to cover \nboth the legal obligations for data residency and \ndata protection and privacy in the respective \nregions. It complements the 4+1 strategy and opti-\nmizes the SAP-wide global rollout. Multi-provider \nportability to avoid expensive vendor lock-in situ -\nation can be achieved by applying a combination \nof SAP and hyperscaler technology (e.g., utilizing \nSAP Gardener for infrastructure abstraction, utiliz -\ning BTP services, building a strategy for native ser -\nvice substitution with equivalent BTP services, \netc.). SAP PlusOne is of strategic importance to \nSAP. It gives us a strategic alternative in case geo-\npolitical, customer demand and competitive offer -\nings requires SAP to reconsider previously sup -\nported infrastructure choices. When developing a \nnew public cloud solution, using PlusOne as Infra -\nstructure as a Service (IaaS) and BTP as PaaS is \nrecommended. Any major changes/additions to \nthe infrastructure need to be discussed and jointly \nagreed upon with the Cloud Delivery Board . For \nmore information, refer to Working with Hyper -\nscalers and PlusOne.\nIncreased demand for compliance with industry, \nregulatory, and security standards is essential for \ncontinued trust of our customers in SAP solutions. \nSAP Business Technology Platform complies with \nISO/BS standards, System and Organization Con -\ntrols (SOC), certifications for industry-specific \nofferings, regional offerings, accessibility, sustain -\nability, ethics, etc. Some examples for such certifi -\ncations are Cloud Computing Compliance Con -\ntrols Catalogue (abbreviated “C5”), EU Cloud Code \nof Conduct (CoC), ISO/IEC 27001, SOC1/2, etc. For \nmore details on the current state of certifications \nand attestations, refer to the Compliance Finder of \nSAP Trust Center.\nIn addition to the SAP public cloud offerings, the \nprivate cloud demand of customers for selected \nsolutions will be addressed depending on the \nbusiness case, considering the costs for applica -\ntions and platform services. The private cloud will \nOne of SAP’s important goals is to reduce the SAP-wide TCO.  \nTo achieve this, we need to optimize the overall deployment footprint  \nand move towards global hub like service offerings. \nGlobal Availability and Rollout Strategy\n\nPage 18:\n16 | 21\nNorth Star Architecture Strategy 2024\nINTERNAL – SAP  Only\naddress a shielded and isolated operation of SAP \nsolutions that is fully under the control of the cus -\ntomer and operated either by in-house personnel \nor a third party.\nSAP offers sovereign clouds  for countries that \nhave additional regulations requiring public sector \nand regulated industries to meet extensive addi -\ntional security levels for their cloud workloads. \nSAP Sovereign Cloud offerings are deployments of \nsecurity-hardened SAP cloud solutions that are \ndesigned to adhere to national security and \nsecrecy requirements such as government accred-\nitation, attestation, or certification programs like \nFedRAMP in the USA, ISM and PSPF in ANZ, and \nCyberEssentials+ in the UK. Sovereign clouds are \noperated within the respective country by SAP \npersonnel with a security clearance by the local \ngovernment. Sovereign clouds and private clouds \ndiffer a lot in the cloud commercial model as well \nas the cloud operations and delivery model. For \nmore information about sovereign cloud require -\nments, countries planned, security hardening pro -\ncedures, etc. refer to SAP Sovereign Cloud \nServices.\nApplications and services deliver mission critical \nuse cases for customers. Implementing High \nAvailability and Disaster Recovery patterns can \nhelp sustain failures in multiple layers (infrastruc -\nture, platform, and application) of our solutions \nand provide more business resilient solutions. To \nincrease resilience against disastrous events like \nfloods, earthquakes, terror attacks, and similar, \ngeo-distant failover mechanisms with redundant \nsetups are recommended. Protection from data \nloss and keeping our solutions highly available not \njust for business continuity, but also for business \nresilience, is the goal. \nGlobal Availability and Rollout Strategy\n\nPage 19:\n17 | 21\nNorth Star Architecture Strategy 2024\nINTERNAL – SAP  Only\nHowever, the integration must not be separate for \nevery application – all SAP applications should be \nperceived as one solution. Thus, we need a central \nendpoint for managing authentication, user man -\nagement, and authorization assignments within all \nSAP applications that must also support the SaaS \nexperience of BTP. SAP Cloud Identity services  \n(SCI) are the key enabler for that. While some cus -\ntomers expect an end-to-end IAM solution from \nSAP, SCI will only be sufficient for rather simple \ncases, and we will not invest in building an end-to-\nend solution but refer to partners to complement \nSCI.\nThe integration of third-party IAM solutions must \nbe based on open standards. The central end -\npoint must both provide a high degree of flexibility \nand be able to integrate well with business net -\nwork identity providers (esp. Ariba Network and \nFieldglass) and SAP Customer Data Cloud for cus -\ntomer IAM scenarios. It must also enable access to \nSAP assets (esp. SAP Universal ID integration).\nWhile the customer’s identity provider is used for \nend user authentication ( TG02.R1), we need a sin -\ngle token issuer at SAP to enable the principal \npropagation across all components within the SAP \necosystem, removing the current need for point-\nto-point trust setups ( TG02.R5). As the SAP eco -\nsystem includes cross-identity consumption sce -\nnarios, this token service must be able to bridge \nthe SAP identity domain with other identity \ndomains, e.g., with Azure Active Directory for \nMicrosoft Teams integration.\nFor service-to-service communication (especially \nSAP-to-SAP), we will introduce cross-platform \nautomated distribution of service identities \n(especially SAP Cloud Root CA-based) and the \nrotation of the relevant keys. Technically this is \nenabled by the Zero Trust Identity Service of BTP.\nImproving and harmonizing identity management \nacross all SAP solutions is a substantial contribu -\ntion to improving the overall user and application \nonboarding experience. For that, we defined an \nSAP-wide SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity \nManagement) API ( TG16), which can be used by \ncustomers to provision users and user-to-role/\ngroup assignments into applications through har -\nmonized SCIM APIs and templates. To achieve the \n“SAP as a whole” goal, we need a bridgehead to \nbe used by third-party identity management tools \nto provision users and assignments. This bridge -\nhead then automatically replicates the data to SAP \napplications. The bridgehead is technically pro -\nvided by SCI.\nWhile we cover central user-to-role/group assign -\nment with the SAP-wide SCIM API, we do not fore -\nsee going for a single authorization engine across \nSAP. Only for BTP and apps that opt in will we stan-\ndardize on the Authorization Management service \n(AMS) of SCI. For backwards compatibility, BTP \nXSUAA needs to morph into SCI.\nWe will also extend the authorization capabilities \nfor privileged access management, e.g., by provid -\ning a mechanism to assign elevated privileges to a \nuser who can execute critical business functions \n(e.g., in case the main responsible user is unavail -\nable). This needs to be done with corresponding \nlogging and monitoring of the user’s activities to \nensure traceability and authorization based on the \n“need to know” and “least privileged” principles \nduring the temporary elevation. We also need \nMany customers have a company-wide identity strategy and a preferred  \nsolution for identity management. Our cloud applications must be able to \nintegrate with them. \nAuthentication, Authorization,  \nand Identity Lifecycle Management\n\nPage 20:\n18 | 21\nNorth Star Architecture Strategy 2024\nINTERNAL – SAP  Only\nthese mechanisms for customer-internal support \nand for SAP development support, who require \naccess to the data in customer applications / ten -\nants.

However, this only happens if some foun -\ndational requirements are met. SaaS solutions \nacross the industry usually come with a service \nlevel agreement (SLA) of around 99.9XX% \n availability. To illustrate this further, an SLA of \n99.99% translates to unavailability of a system for \n8.6 seconds daily, 1:48 mins weekly, 4:21 mins \nmonthly, 13:2.4 mins quarterly, or 52:9.8 mins \nyearly. To achieve such a level of resiliency, appli -\ncations and services need to safeguard against \nunplanned downtimes by avoiding single points of \nfailure, introducing redundancy, and reducing \ndependencies. Defects must be detected as early \nas possible in the development lifecycle, e.g., by \nautomated test strategies. Planned downtimes \nmust be restricted and concepts need to be put in \nplace to avoid such downtimes in case of upgrades \nand updates. At the same time, measures towards \nresiliency must not limit our speed of innovation \nand our ability to deliver new code at a rapid pace \nwithout fear of regression or unplanned outages. \nConsequently, concepts such as controlled \nrelease of new behavior via phased rollout and \nfeature toggles must be leveraged.\nOne key aspect of a SaaS solution is elasticity.  \nSaaS solutions need to scale up, scale down, \nSaaS solutions need to be secure, reliable, scalable, and cost-optimized.  \nThis is enabled by providing clear direction on product architecture, ensuring \na holistic, efficient global use of our 4+1 infrastructure. \nCloud Delivery and Operations\nscale-in, or scale-out automatically based on the \ncurrent load situation. The solutions that are run -\nning idle need to be automatically downsized to \nminimize infrastructure costs. At the same time, \nsufficient resources need to be available for a sta -\nble and performant operation. It is recommended \nthat costs be monitored regularly for resource uti -\nlization and service plans, in addition to designing \nfor cost efficiency. This is a circular process with \napplications being redesigned, resized, recalcu -\nlated, and continuously optimized.\nRunning SaaS solutions also leads to responsibil -\nity for observing the same. Successful \n observability means regularly monitoring the \ncomplete processes end to end across the distrib-\nuted application and service landscapes, soft -\nware, hardware, and network health status, e.g., \nAPI Insights for visibility on API traffic for SAP ten -\nants. To enable the exposure, ingestion, routing & \nprocessing, and consumption of cross-LoB end-\nto-end telemetry signals, Open Telemetry  (OTLP) \nis the chosen SAP-wide standard that needs to be \nfollowed. Applications can continue using their \nexisting telemetry mechanisms and integrate the \ncurrent telemetry signals using the Open Teleme -\ntry Collectors. Refer to the CPA ADRs for formats \nand protocols of Metrics , Trace Correlation , and \nLogs. With OTLP established as the common stan -\ndard for telemetry signals and a cross-LoB routing \nand processing service available, the producers of \ntelemetry signals can be decoupled from poten -\ntial consumers and access and consumption of \ntelemetry signals can be standardized. The focus \ncan then be on the data necessary for different \nmonitoring use cases rather than on individual, \noften proprietary, point-to-point integrations to \ningest them. For more details, refer to the Observ -\nability vision . Early warning capabilities can help\n\nPage 22:\n20 | 21\nNorth Star Architecture Strategy 2024\nINTERNAL – SAP  Only\nminimize the risk of outages. Once it comes to an \noutage, meaningful error codes and distributed \ntracing help identify the problem faster and alert -\ning can help keeping the time to solve the problem \nas low as possible. With standardization of log -\nging, monitoring, and tracing mechanisms, more \nautomated healing mechanisms can also be \ndeployed. The overall result is a much better cus -\ntomer experience, less costs, vendor neutrality, \nbetter alerting, and faster resolution of customer \nissues.\nIn addition to business-application-specific log -\nging, all business applications and cloud services \nthat are offered to customers and/or process cus -\ntomer data must ensure active application and \nsecurity event logging. Products and services must \nintegrate their security event logs into the SAP cor-\nporate SIEM (Security Incident and Event Man-\nagement) central services. The integrity of the \nlogs must be protected from unauthorized change, \ncontinuously monitored, and reviewed. It is the \nresponsibility of the application and service owner \nto ensure that logs are generated and at least tem-\nporarily stored on the IT assets until collected by \nthe central SIEM infrastructure, if not transported \nto SIEM directly. Refer to the SAP Threat Detection \nand Response Management Standard for more \ndetails about minimum log requirements. Also \nrefer to the product standard requirement \n SEC-215: Log security relevant events.\nAnother key aspect of secure cloud delivery is the \nZero Trust Network.  In addition to the public \ncloud applications, SAP also has many internal \nbackend applications where security is equally \nimportant. It needs to be ensured that different \nuse cases run on dedicated landscapes, support \nencrypted communication, and any API calls are \naccess-limited with authentication and authoriza -\ntion with SAP approved identity providers as \ndescribed in “ Authentication, Authorization, and \nIdentity Lifecycle Management ”. In addition, \naccess privileges to the cloud production \ninfrastructure, such as IaaS resources and sys -\ntems, need to be controlled via central access ser-\nvices in accordance with the security product \n standard. In line with Zero Trust principles and to \ncontrol access to cloud resources, the central \naccess services enable admins and operators with \na standardized and secure E2E access path to \ncloud infrastructure resources. For example: An \nadministrator with privileged access to systems for \npatching or troubleshooting or an operator for \nconfiguration of network policies is authorized to \naccess cloud infrastructure resources if the central \naccess system controls a secure authentication, \nchecks for a healthy device posture, and manages \naccess.\nA key aspect of a Zero Trust architecture is Key & \nSecret Management.  SAP systems that deploy \nor maintain access to other systems via machine-\nusable keys, credentials, or secrets should ensure \nthat these are encrypted in the SAP business \napplications. In addition, credentials must not be \nhardcoded into the application or stored in source \ncode. Instead, using a secure vault or credential \nstore is required. Also, keys and secrets must com-\nply with the corporate security requirements – key \nlength, algorithms, retention, key rotation, etc.\nSAP needs to deliver its software consistently, \nautomatically, and frequently. Open Component \nModel is a building block in the delivery toolset. \nUsing one aligned software component model for \nevery LoB is recommended, whereas for services \nowned by BTP its use is mandatory. Further, clear \nAsset Management and Ownership  needs to \nbe provided for all SAP assets, artifacts, and ser -\nvices deployed into the cloud. Such resources \nmust be maintained and kept up- to-date in the \nCentral Configuration Item Repository (CCIR). This \nincludes proper mapping into the SAP organiza -\ntional structure and cost center metrics. Owner -\nless accounts, resources, and services must be \ndeactivated and finally securely deleted (garbage \ncollection).\nCloud Delivery and Operations\n\nPage 23:\n21 | 21\nNorth Star Architecture Strategy 2024\nINTERNAL – SAP  Only\nLocalization is a well-understood topic inside SAP, \nrequiring just the right level of execution across \nthe lifespan of any SAP solution, to enable our cus-\ntomers to focus on sustainable business practices \nand market growth across the globe. The other \nfour priorities define the prevailing vectors from \nwhich the direction of the North Star is derived.\nThe nine overarching topic areas covered in this \nNorth Star document describe the various archi -\ntectural aspects that need to be addressed when \nfollowing our corporate strategy and delivering on \nour SAP mission. There are many important details \nor even larger aspects that cannot be covered in \nsuch a strategy document.

It is therefore essential that you \nmake use of the various existing communication \nchannels of CPA to keep yourself up to date about \nCross Product Architecture topics (see Participat -\ning in CPA).\nSometimes changes or new architectural concepts \nhave a significant impact on the existing codebase \nand consequently require a certain investment to \nadapt to these concepts. On the other hand, if the \noverall value for SAP and for our customers is big -\nger than the investment, these efforts will always \npay off over time.\nAnd finally, technical evolutions should not lead to \ndisruptions for customers regarding user experi -\nence or any needed migration. It should be one of \nour mantras that every technical evolution we \ndrive, independent of its complexity, will be a \nsmooth evolution for our existing customers, but \nprobably a revolution for any new SAP customer.",

For dedicated use cases, certain \nexceptions are acceptable, but require good rea -\nsoning and a conscious decision from the respon -\nsible engineering teams. The teams concerned \nneed to both be aware of the long-term conse -\nquences and accept the implications regarding \nany future evolution, roadmap investments, and \ndaily operations. \nThis North Star Architecture document is based on \nthe 2023 SAP strategy paper and complements \nand updates previous North Star Architecture doc-\numents. Its content is based on the alignment work \nof the Cross-Product Architecture  (CPA) working \ngroups.\nThe CPA collaboration model was established in \n2021 to ensure that technology development is \nwell aligned between technology consumers, pri -\nmarily our lines of business (LoBs) and technology \nproviders, which are typically teams within the \nBusiness Technology Platform (BTP) and some -\ntimes service providers from other organizations. \nCPA focuses on improving integration between \nSAP services and standardizing SAP technology \ncomponents where appropriate. The North Star \nArchitecture became an integral part of CPA, as it \nprovides inputs and guardrails that are then \ndetailed out by the various CPA working groups. \nThis document also considers the strategic direc -\ntion from the Cloud Delivery Architecture  (CDA) \ngroup, which was created in 2023 to drive cloud \ndelivery efficiency along the three dimensions of \n“Cloud Delivery Financial Operations”, “Cloud \nDelivery Process and Tools Efficiency” and “Cloud \nDelivery Architecture Optimization”. In addition, \nthis document puts emphasis on achieving various \ncloud qualities and reducing total cost of opera -\ntions (TCO) of our cloud services. The document is \nnot meant to replace the Product Standards , CPA \nworking group documents , or requirements from \nthe Technology Guidelines (TGs).\nThis North Star Architecture document does not \nprovide detailed coverage of all aspects of soft -\nware architecture. It focuses on the architecture \ntopics that are most relevant and impactful for \nSAP in the near and mid-term future. In addition, \ncertain important cross-cutting aspects are not \ndiscussed in dedicated chapters in this document \nbut are addressed across multiple chapters. For \ninstance, security is a core value for SAP and is \nintegral to all our products. Therefore, the concept \nof \"shift left,\" which involves incorporating security \ncapabilities automatically and transparently \nthrough well-defined processes and tools (such as \nhardened images), is discussed in the “ Business \nApplication Development” chapter as an example. \nSimilarly, the topic of asset management is briefly \nmentioned in the “Cloud Delivery and Operations” \nsection. The same approach has been taken for \nother crucial cross-cutting architectural aspects \nlike reliability and resiliency.\nIn the following nine chapters, which are struc -\ntured into overarching topic areas, this document \ndescribes SAP’s strategic direction.\nThe North Star Architecture document gives guidance for the most strategic \narchitectural topics at SAP. It provides technical recommendations, engineering \nprinciples, architecture guardrails, and best practices for applications and \nservices, addressing a time horizon of three to five years.\nIntroduction\n\nPage 4:\n2 | 21\nNorth Star Architecture Strategy 2024\nINTERNAL – SAP  Only\nOur goal is to enable all SAP products to contribute to a seamless \nuser experience that provides value to our customers by being integrated, \nconsistent, intuitive, insight-driven, and is implemented in a cost-efficient way. \nTo realize this, we must deeply understand the \nuser’s needs. Only then can we design and develop \nthe right user experience that will excite customers \nand makes SAP attractive and competitive in the \nmarket. The user experience of our products must \nalso become more tailored to role-based use cases \nand offer personalization for end user needs.\nTo deliver on this goal, all products must comply \nwith the existing product standards, most promi -\nnently Product Standard UX Consistency (UXC) and \nProduct Standard Accessibility. Furthermore, devel-\nopment teams need to consider the following strat-\negies and guidance:\n • ONE Design System: We must further harmonize \napplication design while providing an inclusive, \ncustomer-first approach to designing and devel -\noping at SAP. The SAP Design System is SAP’s \n unified design system. All web and mobile appli-\ncations across our product portfolio must adopt \nthese concepts and adhere to them to ease the \noverall implementation and foster out-of-the-box \nconsistency (see enablement guide). Established \ndesign guidelines such as Fiori Design Guidelines \nfor Web and BTP UX Toolkit are already built on \ncornerstones like UXC and are being consoli -\ndated into a single SAP Design System Portal to \nprovide guidance for components, patterns, floor-\nplans and even CLI. To enhance and broaden our \nSAP Design System, we are transitioning to an \nInnerSource contribution model across all prod -\nucts managed by Core Design.\n • UI Component Strategy: To enhance UX consis-\ntency across applications, we are further harmo -\nnizing a growing list of technology agnostic \n commonly used components. Accordingly, we are \nextending our UI Technology strategy by offering \nUser Experience\nSAP Web Components for general reuse across \ndifferent UI technologies (e.g., SAPUI5, React, and \nAngular), improving developer efficiency and \nensuring consistent enterprise qualities. Lastly, \nthe creation and contribution of domain-specific \nweb components will be further streamlined \nthrough the Hyperspace Paved Road for SAP \nWeb Components.\n • User Insights: To measure success, product \nteams must collect user insights through a UI con-\ntext-aware Product Experience (PX) Integration \n(TG17 – User Insights ) by embedding standard -\nized Qualtrics surveys. Improvements can also be \nanalyzed with the BTP UX Deep-Dive Dashboard \n(T&I) and the Voice of the User Dashboard (PE).\n • Mobile Experience and Mobile  Technologies: \nMobile applications must be built with SAP Mobile \nTechnologies (e.g., SDK, MDK) using Mobile ser -\nvices ( TG44 – Mobile Technologies ). With these \ntechnologies, SAP, customers, and partners can \nfind clear guidance on how to rapidly build enter-\nprise-grade mobile solutions. Mobile applications \nmust also follow SAP’s mobile design guidelines.\n • Digital Assistant (Joule): For the conversational \nexperience SAP’s Digital Assistant (Joule) must \nbe embedded throughout SAP’s cloud portfolio, \ndelivering contextualized insights. AI UX guidance \nis constantly growing as we learn and iterate. \nWe are building an integrated platform experi -\nence fueled by SAP Kernel Services  to provide \nconsistent access to the same functionality across \nall SAP products, following platform experience \ndesign guidelines. Every product must integrate \nwith these services to enable a common set of UX-\nrelated capabilities.\n\nPage 5:\n3 | 21\nNorth Star Architecture Strategy 2024\nINTERNAL – SAP  Only\nUser Experience\nOur end users often rely on various products and \napplications during the execution of their business \nprocesses. To ensure the best possible support for \nour users, all products for business users must inte-\ngrate with SAP’s central entry points  ( TG01 – \n Central Entry Point and Cross Product Navigation), \ni.e., SAP Start or SAP Build Work Zone editions. \nThese provide simple and intuitive access to appli-\ncations, tasks, processes, and information across \nall SAP products through one underlying common \nplatform. To enable central entry points, products \nmust integrate with kernel services like SAP Build \nWork Zone foundation:\n • Deep Linking: Deep linking capabilities enable \ncross-product navigation. Products must support \ndeep linking (TG01.R1 – Support Deep Linking) to \nallow direct navigation from central entry points \nor product entry points.\n • Content Integration: Products must evolve to \nbecome content providers ( TG01.R2 – Integrate \nwith Central Entry Point) by utilizing the Common \nData Model Replication API to allow for content \naggregation in business users’ central entry \npoints. Essential integration content like business \napplications and deep links are shared via the \nWork Zone platform while assuring a product’s \ntechnical autonomy.\n • Interest Cards: Integrating with the Interest Card \nService ( TG01.R4  – Integrate with Interest Card \nService) allows SAP business solutions to provide \nconsistent, up-to-date information to their busi -\nness users through SAP’s central entry point \nsolutions.\n • Tasks: Kernel service SAP Task Center ( TG13 – \nOne Inbox) provides a single task inbox for web \nand mobile that enables customers to process \ntasks in a streamlined manner.\n • Notifications: Integrating with Notifications  Kernel \nService allows products to make users aware about \nsituations that require timely action or attention. \nNotifications are delivered over various channels – \nweb app, mobile, email, messaging apps, etc. \nTo stay competitive and optimize R&D costs, SAP \nconstantly enhances its UX platform capabilities. \nFurther steps in that direction include the harmo -\nnization of user settings, standardizing themes, \nand centralizing navigation.\nIn addition to enhancing the business user experi -\nence, we put high emphasis on optimizing the user \nexperience for administrators and developers:\nThe journey for administrators begins with their first \ninteraction as potential customers. We’re refining \nthe user experience from the moment customers \ninitiate their first SAP solution rollout, including trial \nor freemium offerings, up to the complete lifecycle- \nand landscape management for all their SAP solu -\ntions. We envision a SaaS user experience that \nempowers customers to focus on their businesses \nrather than on IT infrastructure management. \nThrough holistic landscape management, we intend \nto help customers maximize the value of their SAP \nsolution. Customers will be able to manage all their \nSAP solutions as part of their entire IT landscape, \nwhether they prefer an interactive user interface, a \ncommand line interface, or automation tooling for \nthis purpose. More insights about our technical \napproach can be found in the chapters on \n Integration and Business Technology Platform.\nTransitioning to developers, we understand that UX \ntranscends beyond graphical user interfaces and \ncovers the entire interaction framework. To fuel \ninnovation and evolution in solutions, it is impera -\ntive to provide a consistent and harmonized API \necosystem around our products. This requires a \ndeeper exploration beyond fundamental API pat -\nterns and general concepts for our APIs across all \nSAP solutions (TG03 – Aligned Business APIs). We \nmust design these APIs with both a service provider \nmindset and a focus on our consumers’ use cases. \nWe’re further witnessing a change from command-\nbased interaction to intent-based outcome specifi-\ncations. The interface design needs to empower \ndevelopers to state their outcome (conversational/\nprompts) rather than navigate complex options.\n\nPage 6:\n4 | 21\nNorth Star Architecture Strategy 2024\nINTERNAL – SAP  Only\nWhile we are committed to providing an open, extensible, and heterogeneous \necosystem of tools and services to internal and external developers, we need to \nimprove developer efficiency through harmonization, consolidation, and more \nguidance. \nA major cornerstone of SAP’s success was the abil-\nity to provide a coherent development platform \nfor building business applications in a highly cost \nand time-efficient way. Business application devel-\nopers were able to focus solely on solving busi -\nness-related problems by writing business logic \nrather than being sidetracked by the need to \ndecide among and integrate with a wide range of \ndifferent technical and infrastructure services and \nframeworks. \nThe primary measures of efficiency are the total \ncost of research and development (TCD) and the \ntotal cost of (cloud) operations (TCO). TCD encom-\npasses all costs related to the design and devel -\nopment of the software, including design, imple -\nmentation, testing, and bug fixing. TCO includes \nthe cost for operating and supporting the applica -\ntion. It also refers to efforts for customers to imple-\nment and operate a solution. Development teams \nneed to optimize for both by adhering to the fol -\nlowing guidance:\n • Reduce the overall heterogeneity and \n complexity of technology stacks within SAP. \nThis internal harmonization will help us optimize \ncosts by reducing redundant development and \nmaintenance efforts. Instead, all development \nteams need to proactively seek more reuse. Less \nvariation and more focus will also foster \ninnovation.\n • Expedite the adoption of central services  (by \nimplementing Technology Guidelines ). Kernel \nServices, Unified Services , and others provide \nstandardization, drive reuse, and facilitate seam -\nless and uniform application integration. They \ncontribute to meeting our TCO targets and our \noverall quality criteria by having specialized \nteams focusing on cloud qualities and product \nstandard compliance. Central services consis -\ntently provide reusable, high-quality capabilities \nto all business applications. The services relieve \napplication developers of solving technical \nproblems beyond specific business require -\nments. Apart from a technical scope, Unified Ser-\nvices also cover aspects such as commerciali -\nzation. They facilitate the move from a \nsub scription-based to a consumption-based \ncommercial model (as described in the Commit-\nto-Consume strategy), which typically requires \nsignificant architectural changes. Unified Ser -\nvices (e.g., Unified Account) centrally provide a \nflexible and solid foundation so that future \nchanges of commercial aspects have fewer \nimplications for application and service provid -\ners. This foundation will also be an important \nenabler for an open SAP partner ecosystem by \nreducing the technical integration effort on the \npartner side.\n • Use SAP’s opinionated development models \ntailored to business application developers.  \nDevelopers should focus on business logic \nrather than on boilerplate activities and code. \nDevelopment models such as the SAP Cloud \nApplication Programming Model (CAP) and \nABAP Cloud, comprising the ABAP RESTful \n Application Programming Model (RAP), are the \ndefault choice for application teams.\n • Adopt standard development processes. SAP \nHyperspace offers a standard process frame -\nwork for developing and delivering compliant, \nsecure, and high-quality enterprise software. \nThe provided templates and tools, such as \nBusiness Application Development\n\nPage 7:\n5 | 21\nNorth Star Architecture Strategy 2024\nINTERNAL – SAP  Only\npreconfigured and secure CI/CD pipelines, \nGolden Images, Cloud Native Buildpacks, etc. \nenable developers to focus on core develop -\nment tasks rather than “reinventing” custom pro -\ncesses and tools. Hyperspace also provides \nPaved Roads, which compile best practices and \nprovide guidance that can be leveraged by \ndevelopers through the Hyperspace Portal to \nensure secure-by-default SAP Cloud products \nand deployments to the cloud.\n • Follow best practices and prescribed \ndefaults. The Golden Path (internal)  and the \nBTP Developer’s Guide (external), both driven by \nthe CPA WG “Cloud Development”  and aligned \nacross other related WGs, provide the go-to \narchitecture for the majority of BTP-based busi -\nness applications. The Golden Path contains an \narchitecture blueprint with a curated list of ser -\nvices to integrate with, provides guidance for \nsoftware development and delivery processes, \nand gives instructions on how to deliver on cloud \nqualities and Intelligent Enterprise Suite Quali -\nties. It is equally important to follow the guid -\nance on Optimizing Cost for Cloud Development \nand Operations. This guide provides an overview \nof basic principles for reducing costs by making \nTCO a primary architecture and decision driver \nthroughout the whole development process. As \nwe can only optimize what we can measure, \nmore data points and insights will be needed to \nmonitor and drive cost optimization. While teams \ncan already address this today by implementing \nTCO-tailored logging and metering, a regular \nanalysis of their workload, and a proactive moni -\ntoring of resource utilization, we aim to also pro -\nvide more central support through, e.g., cost \noptimization dashboards, etc. The integration of \nAI capabilities into our development tools will \nalso help drive the implicit adoption of develop -\nment best practices and defaults.\n • Support collaborative development by apply-\ning Open Source ( SAP Open Source Manifesto ) \nand InnerSource. Establishing InnerSource, which \nis the application of methodologies and best \npractices from open-source communities to in-\nhouse software development, will improve devel-\nopment efficiency and productivity. It also  fosters \nreuse and reduces redundant development \nbecause teams can influence/extend reuse \n components with their own contributions.\nBusiness Application Development\n\nPage 8:\n6 | 21\nNorth Star Architecture Strategy 2024\nINTERNAL – SAP  Only\nIt also aims to provide capabilities to integrate with \nthird-party solutions so they can bring their data \ninto the SAP data landscape, as well as giving them \nthe ability to consume SAP data products while \ncomplying with data protection and privacy laws. \nSAP’s data architecture is based around a set of \napplications needed to collect, manage, store, \nand process data. For more information, see “Data \nPlatform – Architecture“.\nWith regard to data persistence, SAP HANA Cloud \nforms the core of our data architecture. It has \nexpanded beyond the original in-memory data -\nbase to include data on disk and data persisted in \nlow-cost cloud object stores. HANA Cloud and \nHANA Cloud Data Lake instances can be deployed \ntogether or separately by LoBs when and where \nneeded. With the focus on multi-tenancy, cost \nreductions, and scalability, HANA Cloud must be \nthe default database, not just for all new cloud \napplications for transaction processing and ana -\nlytics, but also for decomposed (micro) services \nas outlined in an ADR for HANA Cloud . In addition \nto new applications, it is expected that cloud \napplications running on HANA 2.0 on-prem ver -\nsion should migrate to HANA Cloud. What’s more, \nin many (but not all) cases, existing applications \nrunning on third-party databases will benefit from \nmoving to HANA Cloud as outlined in the HANA \nCloud ADR. HANA Cloud Data Lake also provides \na low-cost and scalable data lake storage that can \nbe accessed directly from HANA Cloud via both \nfederation and replication.\nOn the compute front, Spark Compute  is to be \nleveraged for scalable, powerful data engineering \nand AI, operating against data in the HANA Cloud \nData Lake. Spark jobs are used to cleanse, refine, \nand derive data, producing Data Products  that are \ndesigned for consumption. SAP has partnered \nwith Databricks to use their managed Spark ser -\nvice, tightly integrated with the HANA Cloud Data \nLake, with all data persisted in the HANA Cloud \nData Lake. To mitigate the risk of being fully depen-\ndent on third-party technology, an in-house-  \nmanaged Spark service has been built in parallel \nas part of SAP HANA Cloud. The HANA Cloud \nSpark service is initially only being used in the Pro-\ncurement data platform but is expected to extend \nto other use cases in the future.\nSAP Datasphere  (formerly known as Data Ware -\nhouse Cloud with additional data integration fea -\ntures) provides data mart capabilities in support \nof analytics (including cross application) and cus -\ntom data modeling. It also provides data integra -\ntion tools that can be used in conjunction with or \nindependently of the data mart. Datasphere is \nbeing enhanced to provide simple consumption of \nData Products, as well as the ability to publish \nderived Data Products.\nFor data visualization and planning, SAP  Analytics \nCloud (SAC) is the strategic technology choice for \nboth standalone and embedded analytics, see \nTG32. SAC OEM (the embedded version, for \nembedding in SAP applications), is being enhanced \nwith a lightweight viewer to improve performance \nand a shared application tenant to reduce cost. \nFiori/UI5 controls are also a lightweight low-cost \noption for embedding individual analytic controls \nin an application.\nFor distributed data platform architecture, Data \nProducts are the cornerstone, as they enable \nsharing data across domains and application \nboundaries. SAP applications, as well as customer \nand partner applications, can easily publish the \nOur vision is to standardize on a common data architecture that centers on \nenabling LoBs, customers, and partners to easily produce and consume data \nacross application boundaries. \nData Management\n\nPage 9:\n7 | 21\nNorth Star Architecture Strategy 2024\nINTERNAL – SAP  Only\nmetadata describing available Data Products via \nOpen Resource Discovery  (ORD). As the ORD \naggregator, Unified Customer Landscape (UCL) \nwill serve as a Data Products Directory, enabling \napplications and users to both find and discover \nData Products and access the metadata needed \nto consume and understand them in a standard -\nized manner. The Datasphere Catalog will inte -\ngrate with UCL to facilitate consumption and inte -\ngration of Data Products in Datasphere models. \nSAP Business Accelerator Hub will add support \nfor Data Products as a resource type, showing all \nData Products available from SAP applications.\nThe Data Product concept is taken from data mesh \narchitectures, where each domain exposes data \nproducts that others can consume. Data Products \nare data sets that are exposed for consumption via \nan API and enriched by metadata in form of an \nORD document describing the data product and \nindicating where and how it can be accessed. Data \nProducts can be exposed directly from either an \napplication, a HANA Cloud instance, a HANA Data \nLake, or a Datasphere tenant. Moving forward, the \nstrategy is to expose all relevant data needed for \nboth data processing and analytics as Data \nProducts.\nCustomers and SAP also need to be able to com -\nbine data from different applications. To do this, \ntwo things are needed – the ability to uniquely \nidentify business objects in their system land -\nscape and the ability to map the data semantics of \none application to those of another. For the for -\nmer, applications need to expose data with ODM \nIDs (OIDs) and for the latter, applications need to \nexpose data that complies with the ODM 2.0 rules \nand guidelines . Instead of creating only new \naligned integration models, ODM 2.0 is designed \nto extend existing APIs, Events, and Data Products. \nODM enables additional metadata to interconnect \ndata from various applications semantically. In due \ncourse, most business objects exposed by Data \nProducts are expected to be ODM compliant.\nBecause the data is accessed for business trans -\nactions or analytics, it is important to ensure that \nSAP complies with the local data protection and \nprivacy laws. As more countries recognize the \nimportance of mature and secure Data Privacy \nand Protection  (DPP) legislation to ensure their \nsovereignty, covering the increasing complexity of \nthe different country-specific DPP requirements \nand legislation is expected to become more chal -\nlenging in the future. Our aim is to provide the high-\nest standards for DPP across all SAP products and \nprovide a single access point to customers for DPP \ninformation requests or information data access \nreports for all products. The goal is to integrate \nLoB-specific DPP solutions with the Data  Privacy \nIntegration Kernel Service in a federated approach \nfor the creation, processing, transfer, and destruc -\ntion of personal data across application boundar -\nies. For more details on data processing based on \npurpose, refer to the vision of the Working Group \n“Data Protection and Privacy”.\nIn addition, it is important that all data manage -\nment stores be able to use customer-specific \nencryption keys to encrypt relevant data at rest. \nAll applications and services must adopt these \ncapabilities. Customers may also opt in to manage \ntheir encryption keys. The central key manage -\nment will be enabled through a kernel service that \nintegrates internally with SAP’s Data Custodian \nKey Management Service for the customer-  \nmanaged-keys scenario.\nData Management\n\nPage 10:\n8 | 21\nNorth Star Architecture Strategy 2024\nINTERNAL – SAP  Only\nAs of mid-2023, SAP developed more than \n130 embedded AI scenarios. SAP projects can be \ngenerally categorized into the following AI capabili-\nties: machine learning (ML), natural language pro -\ncessing (NLP), conversational AI, computer vision, \nand semantic technologies. SAP’s vision is to infuse \nGenAI-powered innovations across all cloud busi -\nness applications and BTP, embed SAP’s Digital \nAssistant (Joule) in all products, and build SAP-spe-\ncific foundational models. Generative AI capabili -\nties will be offered to our partners and customers \nto build and extend applications. For this purpose, \nwe will provide enterprise-grade qualities, includ -\ning data privacy and security. We will also support \nthe flexibility to adapt to the continuous emergence \nof new use cases and the ongoing evolution of \nGenAI technology.\nFor the conversational experience, SAP’s Digital \nAssistant (Joule) will be embedded throughout \nSAP’s cloud enterprise portfolio, delivering proac -\ntive and contextualized insights from across the \nbreadth and depth of SAP solutions and third-party \nsources. When building conversational capabilities \nfor our business software, we strongly recommend \nintegrating with Joule rather than starting from \nscratch and/or leverage third-party solutions.\nThe large language model (LLM) market is highly \ndynamic, and as new vendors enter the market and \nopen-source models become competitive, costs \nare likely to go down and models will specialize. \nTherefore, SAP will centrally contract, validate, and \nprovide access to LLMs from multiple vendors and \ntake care of many non-functional aspects such as \nsecurity or metering. For this, a generative AI hub \nin AI Core will be provided to SAP business applica-\ntions along with SAP tooling for infrastructure and \nsoftware development (e.g., code generation). LoBs \nshould use the generative AI hub to access \nprovided LLMs. For more information, refer to “Large \nLanguage Model Access at SAP”.\nLLMs come with a significant amount of knowledge, \nbut they do not contain information beyond the \noriginal training data set, such as SAP-specific infor-\nmation or customer-specific information that might \nbe relevant for a use case. To address this limita -\ntion, business data, semantics, and metadata need \nto be incorporated into an LLM request to ground \nthe LLM. To that end, the generative AI hub will pro-\nvide capabilities to integrate with SAP’s data plat -\nform. On top of that, SAP HANA Cloud will provide a \nvector database capability for storing embeddings \nand conducting efficient similarity searches. SAP \nwill adapt LLMs to its context and create its own dif-\nferentiated foundation model that incorporates \nstructured data and business process knowledge \nwith GPT/4HANA. In addition, KG/4HANA  will pro -\nvide semantic context (e.g., via Knowledge Graphs) \nto enable natural-language-based access and \nknowledge-driven exploration of SAP data, as well \nas to scale the training of foundation models.\nSAP is committed to trustworthy and responsi -\nble AI, adhering to a rigorous AI Ethics policy that is \nbinding for all employees. The policy is continu -\nously updated in line with the UNESCO’s AI Ethics \nrecommendations. It is recommended that the \nAI  Ethics Assessment Process be followed while \nbuilding use cases with AI features and functional -\nity. Prioritizing data protection and privacy, SAP \nimplements measures such as partner agreements \nand legal intake processes and uses SAP-hosted \nmodels. Security in AI is emphasized through edu -\ncation programs and countermeasures against \nthreats like data tampering and AI hallucinations. \nSAP is also investing in Explainable AI (XAI) to boost \ntrust and security by making AI-generated outputs \ntransparent.\nRecent breakthroughs in generative AI (GenAI) have created  \nnew opportunities that go far beyond what has been possible until today.\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nPage 11:\n9 | 21\nNorth Star Architecture Strategy 2024\nINTERNAL – SAP  Only\nFor more information on SAP strategy on Genera -\ntive AI, refer to the Generative AI Technology \n Strategy Whitepaper. More guidance for engineer -\ning teams developing LLM use cases can be found \nat the CPA Working Group “AI”.\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nPage 12:\n10 | 21\nNorth Star Architecture Strategy 2024\nINTERNAL – SAP  Only\nThe current reality is that we are still selling indi -\nvidual applications and services that differ signifi -\ncantly in product experiences – e.g., with respect \nto provisioning, integration, and configuration. \nMost of the integration efforts are still offloaded to \nthe customer. We need to address this by putting \nan even stronger focus on enabling a consistent \nSaaS-like experience instead of forcing customers \ninto a PaaS-like (platform as a service) experience, \nasking them to create and manage the technical \nwiring between our applications (creating and \nmaintaining service instances, copying creden -\ntials, etc.) on their own.\nThe foundation for delivering a cloud-like integra -\ntion experience is to clearly separate technical and \nbusiness integration (see Beyond Zones). Techni-\ncal integration refers to all tasks related to setting \nup the technical wiring between applications and/\nor services. This includes establishing trust (e.g., \nby setting up mutual TLS or OAuth-based authen ti-\ncation), the provisioning of integration services (e.g., \nKernel Services) or the application-specific config-\nuration of connections. Business integration, on the \nother hand, refers to all business-related integra -\ntion decisions that the customer makes and mani -\nfests by configuring such a business integration, \nspecifying the intent that different applications (or \ntenants to be more specific) be integrated with each \nother. These business integration decisions are fully \nmanaged by the customer (customer-managed) as \nthey provide the needed flexibility for customers to \nconfigure their business processes. All the required \nunderlying technical integrations, on the other hand, \nneed to be handled automatically by SAP, without \nthe customer even noticing (SAP-managed).\nTaking this even further, we need to deliver smart \nintegration defaults and out-of-the-box automa -\ntion wherever possible. For business integrations, \nthis means that customers get proposals that \nmatch their business intent and landscape setup. \nPreferably, these proposals are provided as part \nof a central UI that facilitates provisioning, integra -\ntion, and configuration in a harmonized experi -\nence. Customers can follow our proposals or \nadjust them to their specific needs. A thorough \nunderstanding of the as-is landscape (provided \nvia landscape introspection capabilities) and \narchitecture templates that model landscape \noptions (provided via architecture blueprints) form \nthe technical basis for smart defaults and the \nunderlying technical automation. Architecture \nblueprints can be seen as executable reference \narchitectures that describe how applications and \nservices are combined into business solutions. \nThey are complemented with information about \nthe current landscape and are enriched with cus -\ntomer input where required. The required land -\nscape data is provided through Unified Landscape \nIntrospection (ULI) capabilities and is retrieved \nfrom different source such as the Cloud Land -\nscape Directory (CLD), Unified Customer Land -\nscape (UCL), or Open Resource Discovery  (ORD) \nfor data on APIs and Events. The resulting solution \nblueprint is the basis for a declarative description \nof the target landscape, the so-called desired \nstate.\nMany of the capabilities mentioned above (the \nseparation of customer-managed business and \nSAP-managed technical integrations, automation \nbased on blueprints, etc.) are facilitated by the \nUnified Services (Unified Provisioning, Unified \nOffering a seamlessly integrated suite of products to our customers remains one \nof our most important strategic aspirations and SAP’s unique selling proposition. \nIt is a fundamental prerequisite for being able to offer end-to-end business \nprocesses and elevate cross-sell opportunities. \nIntegration\n\nPage 13:\n11 | 21\nNorth Star Architecture Strategy 2024\nINTERNAL – SAP  Only\nAccount, Unified Customer Landscape etc.). They \nprovide an LoB-agnostic set of services that eases \nthe integration of applications and services both \nwithin SAP and for partner solutions. Unified Ser -\nvices allow service providers to centrally register \ntheir services as resources in a central repository \nto be consumed by others – independent of where \nand how the services are built. Depending on the \nneeds of the provider, not only can Unified Ser -\nvices be used to orchestrate provisioning and inte-\ngration, they can also address concerns like com -\nmercialization or metering. It should be noted that \nthe objective is not to rip and replace existing \ntools and services but to provide a central control \nplane that glues together the puzzle pieces into a \ncoherent view. Inspired by Kubernetes, Unified \nServices try to achieve this by implementing an \noperator pattern, observing declarative requests \n(the desired state), and acting to fulfill them (the \nactual state). Instead of configuring technical \ndetails imperatively on each singular customer \nsystem, customers will be able to declare changes \nto their systems at an abstract level that reflects \ntheir business needs, while the required technical \nand configuration changes will be automated and \nmanaged by SAP and/or partners.\nApart from streamlining the setup of integrations, we \nalso strive for more guidance and best practices as \nto which patterns should be used to develop inte -\ngrations across applications. Concrete use cases for \nintegrations include, for example, data distribution, \nprocess integration, and side-by-side process \nextensions. We aim to provide more guardrails for \nall cases as to which patterns (e.g., request-driven \nvs. event-driven) and technology should be used by \nthe development teams at SAP. As an example, for \nmaster data we have an aligned target architecture \nconsisting of Master Data Integration (MDI) as the \nservice for replication, entity services as reuse ser-\nvices, and the data architecture for analytical master \ndata consumption.\nFor services that are shared across different appli-\ncation tenants, for example, MDI, Event Broker, Cen-\ntral Entry Point (CEP), Task Center etc., semantics \nand behavior of the tenant IDs currently need to be \naligned with the involved applications, leading to \ninconsistencies, duplicate efforts, and disruption of \nintegration flows in case tenants are moved from \none data center to another. To overcome this, Global \nTenant ID (GTID) must be adopted as a common, \nstable, and unique way to identify the tenants.\nIntegration\n\nPage 14:\n12 | 21\nNorth Star Architecture Strategy 2024\nINTERNAL – SAP  Only\nSAP BTP consists of services, runtimes, and capa -\nbilities that are contributed by various organizations \nin SAP. Detailed information about the foundational \ntopics and technologies on SAP BTP’s way forward \nduring the next five years can be found in the 2023 \nBTP Foundation Technology Strategy paper.\nBTP is moving towards a service-centric \napproach, and we bundle these services for cus -\ntomer-facing offerings. To provide the core capa -\nbilities of an ecosystem, BTP – as the foundation \nof SAP’s Business SaaS offerings – is transforming \nfrom the current runtime-centric approach toward \na multi-cloud, service-centric, and open ecosys -\ntem. All BTP capabilities will be consumable inde -\npendent of the runtime used. We will also remove \ndependencies on specific implementation details \nof BTP services to reduce the architectural com -\nplexity. By eliminating the need for service con -\nsumers to comply with such implementation spe -\ncifics of BTP-provided services, we will reduce the \ncurrent strong coupling among BTP services and \ntheir consumers. That way we will be able to drive \nthe evolution of BTP more efficiently and to adapt \nto changing requirements faster. Consumers will \nalso have more flexibility both when they are \nbuilding solutions on top of BTP, and when they \nare just consuming individual services.\nBTP currently acts as a virtual technical platform \nprovider across different hyperscalers and will be \navailable on SAP Converged Cloud in SAP data \ncenters as well. By means of Unified Services , SAP \nBTP is also extending its capabilities toward pro -\nviding a seamless integration into a harmonized, \nyet flexible commercial and operational frame -\nwork. BTP can then be used more flexibly by any \nsolution as the platform to integrate into the SAP \necosystem. It enables developers to leverage all \nenterprise-grade BTP services, without the need \nto adapt the solution architecture to the technical \nconcepts of BTP. In addition, BTP provides the \noption to leverage hyperscaler or third-party ser -\nvices. This provides a high degree of flexibility to \nsupport evolutionary changes and quick time-to-\nmarket options for applications and services. We \navoid the need for short-term implementations of \nnew and sometimes immature platform features, \nwhich increase the risk of weakening the overall \nenterprise qualities of BTP itself. In case of an \nincreasing demand, we still have the option to \nimplement requested new capabilities on BTP at a \nlater point in time. Thus, we can ensure that all SAP \nquality criteria and the right level of maturity are \nmet. For SAP application and service develop -\nment teams, more guidance can be found in  \n Working with Hyperscalers and PlusOne .\nEnhancing the overall customer experience for \nfully integrated business solutions when leverag -\ning multiple SAP solutions is part of the overall \nSAP strategy. An essential part is providing a seam-\nless SaaS experience for our customers – both \nwithin our own portfolio and with partner solu -\ntions. In addition to direct application-to-applica -\ntion integration, BTP also supports the Integration \nfor SaaS scenario, where selected BTP services \nprovide integration technologies (Master Data \nIntegration, Event Broker, Task Center, etc.) for SAP \napplications (see chapter “Integrations”).\nWe are also harmonizing the various concepts and \ntechnologies that are currently used within SAP for \ntenant provisioning and integration management. \nThe SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) provides the technical foundation \nfor our LoBs, customers, and partners. It is mission critical to SAP’s strategy as \ndocumented in SAP’s Corporate Strategy 2023 paper. One of SAP’s strategic \npriorities is to “Make our SAP BTP the platform for SAP and our ecosystem.”\nBusiness Technology Platform\n\nPage 15:\n13 | 21\nNorth Star Architecture Strategy 2024\nINTERNAL – SAP  Only\nBusiness Technology Platform\nThe goal is one holistic but flexible approach. The \nexisting BTP-specific subscription management \nalso evolves towards this one harmonized \napproach. The target state is to provide technical \nservices and capabilities to holistically manage \napplication tenants and all related integrations \nduring their complete lifecycle and across all SAP \nproducts and partner solutions, regardless of \nwhether these solutions are based on a BTP run -\ntime or not. These capabilities are based on the \nfundamental architectural concepts of the Unified \nServices as described in the “ Integrations” chap -\nter. Consequently, we need to smoothly evolve the \nBTP multi-tenancy approach and untangle vari-\nous orthogonal aspects (tenant, region, trust, secu-\nrity, commercial, etc.) that are currently tightly cou-\npled to the concept of a local BTP subaccount.\nIn parallel to the automated provisioning and inte -\ngration lifecycle management, the appropriate level \nof control is provided to customers, allowing them \nto adapt the configuration to their business-specific \nneeds. This approach allows SAP customers to \nfocus on their core business operations while we \nhandle the technical aspects of their applications \nand integration. We ensure flexibility without the \nneed for customers to understand or work with BTP \nPaaS concepts like subaccounts or runtimes when \nthey are configuring and managing their SAP solu -\ntions and the related integrations. This harmoniza -\ntion also strives to deliver automated orchestration \nof the customer system landscape and the \nrelated integrations. At any time, customers will \nbe able to get an overview of their actual land -\nscape, including BTP-based applications, BTP-\nexternal LoB solutions, connected on-prem solu -\ntions, partner solutions, registered third-party \nsystems, and the related integrations. All landscape \ninformation will be accessible via the Unified Land-\nscape Introspection based on Unified Metadata \nService (UMS) as machine-readable data, so that \napplications can smartly react to changes and \nextensions of the customer’s system landscape.\nA vibrant partner ecosystem around SAP’s cloud \nofferings has been desired for a long time. With \nUnified Services being part of BTP, we will provide \nthe technical foundation for an open SAP ecosys -\ntem. Functionality like seamless integration into \nthe SAP marketplace or leveraging fully managed \nmetering and billing infrastructure will not only be \navailable SAP internally, it will also be offered to \npartners to build a vital and growing ecosystem \naround SAP’s core business solutions. For part -\nners and independent software vendors (ISVs), we \nwill lower the entry barrier by providing more guid-\nance, frameworks, and tools. Partners and ISVs \nwill be able to offer and monetize their solutions \non the SAP marketplace, regardless of whether \ntheir solutions are built on a BTP runtime or not.\nWe are also untangling the cloud services manage-\nment, including account and subscription manage-\nment, provisioning, integration management, meter-\ning, and commercialization from the core BTP PaaS \ncapabilities and providing them as decoupled \n Unified Services. This allows all non-BTP SAP appli-\ncations and partner solutions to leverage them as \nwell. When fully leveraging BTP as the platform for \ndeveloping and hosting a business solution, inte -\ngration into the SAP ecosystem is provided out-of-\nthe-box without any additional effort. Business \nsolutions that do not use BTP PaaS capabilities can \nstill benefit from BTP by consuming any of the BTP-\nprovided services. All business solutions must \nadopt Unified Services to be seamlessly integrated \ninto the SAP ecosystem and made available to cus-\ntomers through the SAP Marketplace.\nBTP provides all its PaaS capabilities in the form \nof enterprise-grade services and qualities that are \nunderpinning the Golden Path guidance to increase \nthe efficiency of SAP developers. These PaaS enter-\nprise-grade capabilities include connectivity, inte -\ngration, reliability, scalability, compliance, security, \noperational aspects, and multi-cloud abstraction. \nTo further improve the overall platform experience \nand developer efficiency, customer-facing APIs are \nconstantly being enhanced and the automation \ncapabilities are being extended.\nSAP’s solutions offer dependable audits and com-\npliance checks, covering various national and inter-\nnational standards related to information security\n\nPage 16:\n14 | 21\nNorth Star Architecture Strategy 2024\nINTERNAL – SAP  Only\nBusiness Technology Platform\nand data protection. For this data protection and \nprivacy (DPP) aspect, BTP also caters to special \nrequirements such as “EU Access Only” for sensi -\ntive industries as part of these PaaS capabilities.\nWe are introducing capabilities in BTP that enable \nit to be run in Private and Sovereign Clouds.  \nThis expands our business opportunities, as it \nallows customers to run BTP workloads in their \nown data centers or dedicated data centers to ful-\nfill specific regulatory and/or legal requirements. \nWe also support “air-gapped” environments where \ndedicated operators handle SRE (Site Reliability \nEngineering) responsibilities. Technologically, \n Gardener and IronCore (aka “Gardener on Metal”) \nwill support these distributed environments with a \nconsistent approach to infrastructure manage -\nment. However, there will also be changes to pro -\ncesses, operational models, software delivery, \ncloud services management, and core platform \nservices to accommodate Private Cloud.\n\nPage 17:\n15 | 21\nNorth Star Architecture Strategy 2024\nINTERNAL – SAP  Only\nDeployments of cloud solutions are preferably \nlocated in consolidated locations to avoid complex-\nity in operations and support. Aligned placement of \ndeployments across the entire SAP portfolio is \ntherefore required to support the best experience \nfor customers, maximize business value, and to opti-\nmize our delivery efficiency and TCO.\nIn addition, consumption of each service either \nlocally in each infrastructure region (CAT-1), or \ncross consumption across infrastructure once per \nregion (CAT-2), or once globally (CAT-3) is deter -\nmined via a categorization  based on technical, \nlegal, and regulatory aspects like data residency \nrequirements. It’s important that services that are \noffered for cross-consumption be remotely acces-\nsible from any infrastructure region, especially the \nCAT-2 and CAT-3 services. This includes, but is not \nlimited to, decoupling from the current BTP subac-\ncount, ensuring that the service supports authenti -\ncation with SSO, integrated audit logs, ready-to-\nuse tenant setups, compliance with regulatory \nrequirements, etc.\nTo react faster to growing customer demands, SAP \nalso needs to provide more flexibility regarding \nthe presence of our products (including BTP) in \nnew regions and markets. For BTP and its related \nservices, this is planned to be achieved via \n satellites and ground stations. Ground stations are \ninfrastructure regions with a CloudFoundry land -\nscape and a BTP Region local control plane. Satel-\nlites are a group of services deployed into an infra-\nstructure region where no BTP ground station is \npresent. With this approach, we expect to cover \nboth the legal obligations for data residency and \ndata protection and privacy in the respective \nregions. It complements the 4+1 strategy and opti-\nmizes the SAP-wide global rollout. Multi-provider \nportability to avoid expensive vendor lock-in situ -\nation can be achieved by applying a combination \nof SAP and hyperscaler technology (e.g., utilizing \nSAP Gardener for infrastructure abstraction, utiliz -\ning BTP services, building a strategy for native ser -\nvice substitution with equivalent BTP services, \netc.). SAP PlusOne is of strategic importance to \nSAP. It gives us a strategic alternative in case geo-\npolitical, customer demand and competitive offer -\nings requires SAP to reconsider previously sup -\nported infrastructure choices. When developing a \nnew public cloud solution, using PlusOne as Infra -\nstructure as a Service (IaaS) and BTP as PaaS is \nrecommended. Any major changes/additions to \nthe infrastructure need to be discussed and jointly \nagreed upon with the Cloud Delivery Board . For \nmore information, refer to Working with Hyper -\nscalers and PlusOne.\nIncreased demand for compliance with industry, \nregulatory, and security standards is essential for \ncontinued trust of our customers in SAP solutions. \nSAP Business Technology Platform complies with \nISO/BS standards, System and Organization Con -\ntrols (SOC), certifications for industry-specific \nofferings, regional offerings, accessibility, sustain -\nability, ethics, etc. Some examples for such certifi -\ncations are Cloud Computing Compliance Con -\ntrols Catalogue (abbreviated “C5”), EU Cloud Code \nof Conduct (CoC), ISO/IEC 27001, SOC1/2, etc. For \nmore details on the current state of certifications \nand attestations, refer to the Compliance Finder of \nSAP Trust Center.\nIn addition to the SAP public cloud offerings, the \nprivate cloud demand of customers for selected \nsolutions will be addressed depending on the \nbusiness case, considering the costs for applica -\ntions and platform services. The private cloud will \nOne of SAP’s important goals is to reduce the SAP-wide TCO.  \nTo achieve this, we need to optimize the overall deployment footprint  \nand move towards global hub like service offerings. \nGlobal Availability and Rollout Strategy\n\nPage 18:\n16 | 21\nNorth Star Architecture Strategy 2024\nINTERNAL – SAP  Only\naddress a shielded and isolated operation of SAP \nsolutions that is fully under the control of the cus -\ntomer and operated either by in-house personnel \nor a third party.\nSAP offers sovereign clouds  for countries that \nhave additional regulations requiring public sector \nand regulated industries to meet extensive addi -\ntional security levels for their cloud workloads. \nSAP Sovereign Cloud offerings are deployments of \nsecurity-hardened SAP cloud solutions that are \ndesigned to adhere to national security and \nsecrecy requirements such as government accred-\nitation, attestation, or certification programs like \nFedRAMP in the USA, ISM and PSPF in ANZ, and \nCyberEssentials+ in the UK. Sovereign clouds are \noperated within the respective country by SAP \npersonnel with a security clearance by the local \ngovernment. Sovereign clouds and private clouds \ndiffer a lot in the cloud commercial model as well \nas the cloud operations and delivery model. For \nmore information about sovereign cloud require -\nments, countries planned, security hardening pro -\ncedures, etc. refer to SAP Sovereign Cloud \nServices.\nApplications and services deliver mission critical \nuse cases for customers. Implementing High \nAvailability and Disaster Recovery patterns can \nhelp sustain failures in multiple layers (infrastruc -\nture, platform, and application) of our solutions \nand provide more business resilient solutions. To \nincrease resilience against disastrous events like \nfloods, earthquakes, terror attacks, and similar, \ngeo-distant failover mechanisms with redundant \nsetups are recommended. Protection from data \nloss and keeping our solutions highly available not \njust for business continuity, but also for business \nresilience, is the goal. \nGlobal Availability and Rollout Strategy\n\nPage 19:\n17 | 21\nNorth Star Architecture Strategy 2024\nINTERNAL – SAP  Only\nHowever, the integration must not be separate for \nevery application – all SAP applications should be \nperceived as one solution. Thus, we need a central \nendpoint for managing authentication, user man -\nagement, and authorization assignments within all \nSAP applications that must also support the SaaS \nexperience of BTP. SAP Cloud Identity services  \n(SCI) are the key enabler for that. While some cus -\ntomers expect an end-to-end IAM solution from \nSAP, SCI will only be sufficient for rather simple \ncases, and we will not invest in building an end-to-\nend solution but refer to partners to complement \nSCI.\nThe integration of third-party IAM solutions must \nbe based on open standards. The central end -\npoint must both provide a high degree of flexibility \nand be able to integrate well with business net -\nwork identity providers (esp. Ariba Network and \nFieldglass) and SAP Customer Data Cloud for cus -\ntomer IAM scenarios. It must also enable access to \nSAP assets (esp. SAP Universal ID integration).\nWhile the customer’s identity provider is used for \nend user authentication ( TG02.R1), we need a sin -\ngle token issuer at SAP to enable the principal \npropagation across all components within the SAP \necosystem, removing the current need for point-\nto-point trust setups ( TG02.R5). As the SAP eco -\nsystem includes cross-identity consumption sce -\nnarios, this token service must be able to bridge \nthe SAP identity domain with other identity \ndomains, e.g., with Azure Active Directory for \nMicrosoft Teams integration.\nFor service-to-service communication (especially \nSAP-to-SAP), we will introduce cross-platform \nautomated distribution of service identities \n(especially SAP Cloud Root CA-based) and the \nrotation of the relevant keys. Technically this is \nenabled by the Zero Trust Identity Service of BTP.\nImproving and harmonizing identity management \nacross all SAP solutions is a substantial contribu -\ntion to improving the overall user and application \nonboarding experience. For that, we defined an \nSAP-wide SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity \nManagement) API ( TG16), which can be used by \ncustomers to provision users and user-to-role/\ngroup assignments into applications through har -\nmonized SCIM APIs and templates. To achieve the \n“SAP as a whole” goal, we need a bridgehead to \nbe used by third-party identity management tools \nto provision users and assignments. This bridge -\nhead then automatically replicates the data to SAP \napplications. The bridgehead is technically pro -\nvided by SCI.\nWhile we cover central user-to-role/group assign -\nment with the SAP-wide SCIM API, we do not fore -\nsee going for a single authorization engine across \nSAP. Only for BTP and apps that opt in will we stan-\ndardize on the Authorization Management service \n(AMS) of SCI. For backwards compatibility, BTP \nXSUAA needs to morph into SCI.\nWe will also extend the authorization capabilities \nfor privileged access management, e.g., by provid -\ning a mechanism to assign elevated privileges to a \nuser who can execute critical business functions \n(e.g., in case the main responsible user is unavail -\nable). This needs to be done with corresponding \nlogging and monitoring of the user’s activities to \nensure traceability and authorization based on the \n“need to know” and “least privileged” principles \nduring the temporary elevation. We also need \nMany customers have a company-wide identity strategy and a preferred  \nsolution for identity management.

However, this only happens if some foun -\ndational requirements are met. SaaS solutions \nacross the industry usually come with a service \nlevel agreement (SLA) of around 99.9XX% \n availability. To illustrate this further, an SLA of \n99.99% translates to unavailability of a system for \n8.6 seconds daily, 1:48 mins weekly, 4:21 mins \nmonthly, 13:2.4 mins quarterly, or 52:9.8 mins \nyearly. To achieve such a level of resiliency, appli -\ncations and services need to safeguard against \nunplanned downtimes by avoiding single points of \nfailure, introducing redundancy, and reducing \ndependencies. Defects must be detected as early \nas possible in the development lifecycle, e.g., by \nautomated test strategies. Planned downtimes \nmust be restricted and concepts need to be put in \nplace to avoid such downtimes in case of upgrades \nand updates. At the same time, measures towards \nresiliency must not limit our speed of innovation \nand our ability to deliver new code at a rapid pace \nwithout fear of regression or unplanned outages. \nConsequently, concepts such as controlled \nrelease of new behavior via phased rollout and \nfeature toggles must be leveraged.\nOne key aspect of a SaaS solution is elasticity.  \nSaaS solutions need to scale up, scale down, \nSaaS solutions need to be secure, reliable, scalable, and cost-optimized.  \nThis is enabled by providing clear direction on product architecture, ensuring \na holistic, efficient global use of our 4+1 infrastructure. \nCloud Delivery and Operations\nscale-in, or scale-out automatically based on the \ncurrent load situation. The solutions that are run -\nning idle need to be automatically downsized to \nminimize infrastructure costs. At the same time, \nsufficient resources need to be available for a sta -\nble and performant operation. It is recommended \nthat costs be monitored regularly for resource uti -\nlization and service plans, in addition to designing \nfor cost efficiency. This is a circular process with \napplications being redesigned, resized, recalcu -\nlated, and continuously optimized.\nRunning SaaS solutions also leads to responsibil -\nity for observing the same. Successful \n observability means regularly monitoring the \ncomplete processes end to end across the distrib-\nuted application and service landscapes, soft -\nware, hardware, and network health status, e.g., \nAPI Insights for visibility on API traffic for SAP ten -\nants. To enable the exposure, ingestion, routing & \nprocessing, and consumption of cross-LoB end-\nto-end telemetry signals, Open Telemetry  (OTLP) \nis the chosen SAP-wide standard that needs to be \nfollowed. Applications can continue using their \nexisting telemetry mechanisms and integrate the \ncurrent telemetry signals using the Open Teleme -\ntry Collectors. Refer to the CPA ADRs for formats \nand protocols of Metrics , Trace Correlation , and \nLogs. With OTLP established as the common stan -\ndard for telemetry signals and a cross-LoB routing \nand processing service available, the producers of \ntelemetry signals can be decoupled from poten -\ntial consumers and access and consumption of \ntelemetry signals can be standardized. The focus \ncan then be on the data necessary for different \nmonitoring use cases rather than on individual, \noften proprietary, point-to-point integrations to \ningest them. For more details, refer to the Observ -\nability vision . Early warning capabilities can help\n\nPage 22:\n20 | 21\nNorth Star Architecture Strategy 2024\nINTERNAL – SAP  Only\nminimize the risk of outages. Once it comes to an \noutage, meaningful error codes and distributed \ntracing help identify the problem faster and alert -\ning can help keeping the time to solve the problem \nas low as possible. With standardization of log -\nging, monitoring, and tracing mechanisms, more \nautomated healing mechanisms can also be \ndeployed. The overall result is a much better cus -\ntomer experience, less costs, vendor neutrality, \nbetter alerting, and faster resolution of customer \nissues.\nIn addition to business-application-specific log -\nging, all business applications and cloud services \nthat are offered to customers and/or process cus -\ntomer data must ensure active application and \nsecurity event logging. Products and services must \nintegrate their security event logs into the SAP cor-\nporate SIEM (Security Incident and Event Man-\nagement) central services. The integrity of the \nlogs must be protected from unauthorized change, \ncontinuously monitored, and reviewed. It is the \nresponsibility of the application and service owner \nto ensure that logs are generated and at least tem-\nporarily stored on the IT assets until collected by \nthe central SIEM infrastructure, if not transported \nto SIEM directly. Refer to the SAP Threat Detection \nand Response Management Standard for more \ndetails about minimum log requirements. Also \nrefer to the product standard requirement \n SEC-215: Log security relevant events.\nAnother key aspect of secure cloud delivery is the \nZero Trust Network.  In addition to the public \ncloud applications, SAP also has many internal \nbackend applications where security is equally \nimportant. It needs to be ensured that different \nuse cases run on dedicated landscapes, support \nencrypted communication, and any API calls are \naccess-limited with authentication and authoriza -\ntion with SAP approved identity providers as \ndescribed in “ Authentication, Authorization, and \nIdentity Lifecycle Management ”. In addition, \naccess privileges to the cloud production \ninfrastructure, such as IaaS resources and sys -\ntems, need to be controlled via central access ser-\nvices in accordance with the security product \n standard. In line with Zero Trust principles and to \ncontrol access to cloud resources, the central \naccess services enable admins and operators with \na standardized and secure E2E access path to \ncloud infrastructure resources. For example: An \nadministrator with privileged access to systems for \npatching or troubleshooting or an operator for \nconfiguration of network policies is authorized to \naccess cloud infrastructure resources if the central \naccess system controls a secure authentication, \nchecks for a healthy device posture, and manages \naccess.\nA key aspect of a Zero Trust architecture is Key & \nSecret Management.  SAP systems that deploy \nor maintain access to other systems via machine-\nusable keys, credentials, or secrets should ensure \nthat these are encrypted in the SAP business \napplications. In addition, credentials must not be \nhardcoded into the application or stored in source \ncode. Instead, using a secure vault or credential \nstore is required. Also, keys and secrets must com-\nply with the corporate security requirements – key \nlength, algorithms, retention, key rotation, etc.\nSAP needs to deliver its software consistently, \nautomatically, and frequently. Open Component \nModel is a building block in the delivery toolset. \nUsing one aligned software component model for \nevery LoB is recommended, whereas for services \nowned by BTP its use is mandatory. Further, clear \nAsset Management and Ownership  needs to \nbe provided for all SAP assets, artifacts, and ser -\nvices deployed into the cloud. Such resources \nmust be maintained and kept up- to-date in the \nCentral Configuration Item Repository (CCIR). This \nincludes proper mapping into the SAP organiza -\ntional structure and cost center metrics. Owner -\nless accounts, resources, and services must be \ndeactivated and finally securely deleted (garbage \ncollection).\nCloud Delivery and Operations\n\nPage 23:\n21 | 21\nNorth Star Architecture Strategy 2024\nINTERNAL – SAP  Only\nLocalization is a well-understood topic inside SAP, \nrequiring just the right level of execution across \nthe lifespan of any SAP solution, to enable our cus-\ntomers to focus on sustainable business practices \nand market growth across the globe. The other \nfour priorities define the prevailing vectors from \nwhich the direction of the North Star is derived.\nThe nine overarching topic areas covered in this \nNorth Star document describe the various archi -\ntectural aspects that need to be addressed when \nfollowing our corporate strategy and delivering on \nour SAP mission. There are many important details \nor even larger aspects that cannot be covered in \nsuch a strategy document. However, you will find \nthat most of these are discussed and driven in one \nof the workstreams within the Cross-Product Archi-\ntecture working groups.\nThe Cross-Product Architecture is continuously \nevolving to adapt to the technical evolution around \nus, but also to constantly improve efficiency and \nAs defined in the deep dive section of SAP’s Corporate Strategy 2023,  \nthe five cross priorities for all of us are Integration, Embedded AI, Next-Gen UX, \nCloud Operational Excellence, and Localization. \nA Final Word\nthe overall user experience, and to cover new \nrequirements. It is therefore essential that you \nmake use of the various existing communication \nchannels of CPA to keep yourself up to date about \nCross Product Architecture topics (see Participat -\ning in CPA).\nSometimes changes or new architectural concepts \nhave a significant impact on the existing codebase \nand consequently require a certain investment to \nadapt to these concepts. On the other hand, if the \noverall value for SAP and for our customers is big -\nger than the investment, these efforts will always \npay off over time.\nAnd finally, technical evolutions should not lead to \ndisruptions for customers regarding user experi -\nence or any needed migration. It should be one of \nour mantras that every technical evolution we \ndrive, independent of its complexity, will be a \nsmooth evolution for our existing customers, but \nprobably a revolution for any new SAP customer.\n\n=== Legal Notice For SAP Materials (http://www.sap.com/legal-notice) ===\nLegal Notice For SAP Materials Javascript must be enabled for the correct page display Skip to Content Contact Us Contact us Chat now Legal Notice Legal Notice For General Materials Intended for General Audiences September 2023 SAP general materials intended for general audiences that contain information about SAP products and services (“General Materials”) are provided by SAP SE or an SAP affiliate company for informational purposes only, without representation or warranty of any kind.
