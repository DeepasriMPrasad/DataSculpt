Consequently, all applications will run in the cloud. An Intelligent Enterprise will also differ <br>from others in that it manages and supports all these cloud applications with one application lifecycle <br>management (ALM) in the Cloud, the SAP Cloud ALM. <br>With thousands of live SAP Solution Managers, SAP has already proven the importance of one ALM <br>in our installed base and continues to delight our customers regarding the service and support <br>lifecycle. With SAP Cloud ALM's ease of consumption of SAP applications in the cloud, hybrid and <br>on-premise is the focus. Consequently, SAP Cloud ALM is enabled to cope with the much higher <br>frequency of innovation cycles in the cloud. Our mantra is DAILY! <br>We, the engineers, have fundamentally changed the development and deployment processes – all <br>based on the core belief of "only one valid version of the code, no bifurcation of code , and <br>consequently no older releases anymore ." A simplified code lifecycle  powered by Deploy with <br>Confidence (https://dwc.tools.sap/). We cont inuously deliver and deploy to our live customers , <br>DAILY. <br>The engineering experience has become a sustainable cloud journey for all of us, which drives <br>customer satisfaction and employee engagement, all based on high , instantaneous adoption of the <br>newest features and robust automation , improving quality every day. We have reached a totally <br>different level of quality already, knowing that we will have to get much better at running > 50'000 <br>customers soon. <br>The vision of "powered by CALM " goes beyond this. All transformation enablers from Business <br>Process Management and Business Transformation Services (incl . data transformation, mergers & <br>and carve-outs) are powered by SAP Cloud ALM , e2e quality ensured and integrated with SAP <br>Service & Support.<br><br>Page 6:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 6 of 66 <br> <br> <br>     Figure 1 – Evolution of SAP Application Lifecycle Management to Business Transformation Suite<br><br>Page 7:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 7 of 66 <br> <br>1 Abstract <br>This document provides guidance and rules for cloud development in CSUP-CXS (Customer <br>Experience and Solutions). SAP Cloud ALM is SAP's cloud-based application lifecycle management <br>offering. https://support.sap.com/en/alm/sap-cloud-alm.html  <br>SAP Cloud ALM is built on the SAP Business Technology Platform. Implementation follows a cloud-<br>native, micro-service architecture pattern. The software is deployed into several provider accounts <br>across the globe and consumed by the customer per Software as a Service (SaaS) subscription.  <br>SAP Cloud ALM is a "Customer managed SaaS application " and contains more than 80 <br>microservices. Microservices are implemented in Java (node.js is possible too, but so far we avoided <br>limiting DevOps complexity). We use Deploy with Confidence (DwC), Cloud Application Programming <br>Model (CAP), and SAP Cloud SDK (more details on these tools are provided in this document). <br>We use  domain-driven design  to model the microservices.  Data separation is done by creating <br>separate database schemas (HDI container) in SAP HANA Cloud - per customer tenant and domain. <br>Depending on the criticality of the microservices, we can run the services on a standard SAP HANA <br>service plan or a high-availability SAP HANA instance. For resilience reasons, the HDI containers of <br>the 80 microservices are distributed across (currently) 20 SAP HANA Cloud Instances per SAP Cloud <br>ALM deployment. <br>This ACD … <br>• Provides a summary of the business requirements of SAP Cloud ALM <br>• Describe our engineering culture and process <br>• Lists architecture guiding principles and  <br>• Architecture decisions that we have made based on the business needs and principles <br>The document is a summary of all aspects.

Multi-tenancy refers <br>to software architecture in which tenants share the same technical resources but isolate data and<br><br>Page 11:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 11 of 66 <br> <br>users. In SAP BTP - Cloud Foundry, we have a single instance of the application that serves <br>multiple customers (tenants). See the BTP Multi-tenancy wiki page at <br>https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/x/dg5rbQ. We develop adhering to the 12 Factor Apps principle <br>https://12factor.net. <br> <br>Build, Run, and Service are represented by currently ~50 microservices. There are a few more to <br>come, so maybe we reach about 65 in 2022.  <br>All CALM microservices are consumed by customers in customer-owned BTP Sub-accounts. <br>This type of subscription scenario, on top of a customer-owned BTP account, is called a customer-<br>managed SaaS application. <br>Like for all customer-managed SaaS applications, the customer is responsible for the global <br>account, the subaccounts, the assignment of the IAS Tenant, the subscription, the configuration of <br>the cloud services, etc. However, where possible, we provide setup automation capabilities to <br>simplify and streamline customer tasks. <br>There is an automated CALM-customer-tenant onboarding process. Interested customers can <br>trigger it from a corresponding SAP for Me application. This will create one global account with a <br>sub-account subscribed to CALM. The customer could define additional sub-accounts and <br>subscribe to SAP Cloud ALM manually multiple times. However, this is not in focus now. We head <br>to the fact that each customer needs just a single subscription to CALM. <br>We head for a common architecture in SAP Cloud ALM Build, Run, and Service Delivery Cloud. <br> <br>  <br>Number of Customers <br>expected  <br>2019:        50 <br>2020:      300 <br>2021:   1.000 <br>2022:   3.000 <br>2023:   5.000 <br>2024:   8.000 <br>2027: 50.000 <br>Underlying <br>Platform/Application Server  <br>SAP BTP / Cloud Foundry environment; more than 50 microservices <br>implemented in Java.

It is Open <br>and Opinionated and supports SAP-centric cloud-native solutions.  <br> <br>Figure 5 - CXS Cloud Stack based on SAP BTP Strategy Paper - Slides <br> <br>The software stack enables programming services with the so-called Cloud Application Programming <br>Model of SAP BTP. <br> <br>The SAP Cloud Application Programming model is SAP's way of guiding you through cloud <br>application development by offering a consistent end -to-end programming model that includes SAP <br>and open -source tools, languages, libraries, and APIs tailored for service and application <br>development on the SAP Business Technology Platform.  <br>You can say it is both "open" and "opinionated", because while it does give you flexibility and choice, <br>it also marks a clear golden path through best practices & guidelines. For example, you can use <br>SAP Business Application Studio , Eclipse, Visual Studio Code , IntelliJ IDEA , or any other <br>development tool you choose. <br>The cloud application programming model saves from adding boilerplate code and lets you focus on <br>differentiating and personalized features specific to your business needs.  <br>For more information, see help.sap.com and Golden Path: Guiding Engineers to Successfully Built <br>SAP BTP Cloud Applications <br>Following the CAP model, each CXS microservice has the following high-level integration <br>architecture:<br><br>Page 13:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 13 of 66 <br> <br>  <br>Figure 6 - CALM microservice architecture <br> <br> <br>Details on investigated alternative architecture stacks can be found in the architecture decision <br>record ADR-0010 Choice of Technology Platform & Runtime for SAP Cloud ALM SaaS Application<br><br>Page 14:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 14 of 66 <br> <br>2 Business Requirements for SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>The scope of SAP Cloud ALM is to: <br>• Deliver the best customer support experience in the industry. <br>• Minimize customer effort to adopt and operate the Intelligent Enterprise Suite. <br>• Reduced total cost of implementation and end-to-end Operation. <br>• Consolidate all the solutions that help SAP customers implement faster and operate <br>better. <br>The characteristics of SAP Cloud ALM are:  <br>• It is cloud-based to achieve an exceptional end-to-end support experience for multi-cloud <br>and hybrid SAP solutions.   <br>• Free of charge for the customer. Usage rights are already included with SAP Enterprise <br>Support. <br>• Support SAP to attract cloud-only and cloud-first customers and to keep customers for life.  <br>The new cloud offering s can be better understood when bringing them into the relation/context of <br>SAP Solution Manager. SAP Solution Manager 7.2 is the tool of choice to provide application lifecycle <br>management for all SAP on -premise products, partially also hybrid landscapes.  We assume cloud-<br>only- and cloud-first customers have only low or no  on-premise footprint. Such customers will not <br>operate an on-premise SAP Solution Manager system. <br>Therefore, SAP Cloud ALM, including Cloud Service Delivery, was introduced to cover that area. SAP <br>Cloud ALM capabilities can be grouped into Build (Implementation), Run (Operation), and Service. <br>1. SAP Cloud ALM Build (CBuild / Implementation) covers the business process "Requirements <br>to Deploy". It consists of several features, for example, process management, implementation <br>projects, change and deployment management, test management, etc.  <br> <br>CALM Build – Process Model  <br>CALM Build – Overview Screen <br> <br>2. SAP Cloud ALM Run (CRUN / Operations) covers the business process "Predict to Avoid". It <br>consists of features like integration monitoring, business process monitoring, user monitoring, <br>etc.  <br>CRUN is handled by Technology Guideline 11 (TG11); Slides and Demo recording from <br>S/4HANA Cloud Day.<br><br>Page 15:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 15 of 66 <br> <br> <br>CALM Run Integration Monitoring <br> <br>Integration Monitoring - Analytics <br> <br>3. SAP Cloud ALM Service covers the service delivery center, service execution engine, <br>service/check authoring, template asset management, issue and action management, and <br>service results. SAP Cloud ALM Service offers features for SAP employees (internal facing) as <br>well as for SAP Cloud ALM customer users (external users). There are several communication <br>and integration scenarios between internal-facing and external-facing applications.  <br> <br> <br>CALM Service – Launchpad Tiles <br>   <br>  Service Explorer – Services <br> <br> <br>Service Delivery Center – Overview<br><br>Page 16:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 16 of 66 <br> <br>Press Release: SAP Cloud ALM Enhances Support for Cloud-Based Solutions on 05/2020 <br> <br>WALLDORF — SAP SE (NYSE: SAP) announced multiple updates to the SAP Cloud ALM <br>solution today. The cloud-based application lifecycle management (ALM) solution helps <br>track and manage the needs of customers of cloud solutions from SAP.    <br>https://news.sap.com/2020/05/sap-cloud-alm-enhances-support-for-cloud-based-solutions/ <br>As a result of the update, SAP Cloud ALM will support additional SAP <br>solutions – including SAP S/4HANA Cloud, SAP SuccessFactors solutions, <br>SAP Customer Experience solutions, and SAP Ariba solutions. SAP Cloud <br>ALM was redesigned with improved capabilities to simplify the <br>implementation and operations experience as more customers move to the <br>cloud. <br>"As the cloud landscape advances and cloud solutions become more important, it's critical to continuously <br>update SAP Cloud ALM to meet expectations of a cloud customer mindset," said Marc Thier, SVP of <br>Application Lifecycle Management, SAP. "Over the last year and a half, we've focused on simplicity and <br>evolving SAP Cloud ALM so the platform can be used by business and IT roles with no need for technical <br>knowledge." <br>SAP Cloud ALM benefits customers during various innovation cycles, including: <br>• Easy deployment for companies that choose SAP S/4HANA Cloud and SAP <br>SuccessFactors solutions: SAP Cloud ALM helps with team onboarding and fit-to-<br>standard workshops for configuring the customer's cloud solution. It tracks project progress <br>by guiding customers through the implementation process and reports project status <br>automatically. <br>• Integration for customers who use more than one cloud service: When managing <br>multiple cloud services – such as SAP S/4HANA Cloud, SAP SuccessFactors solutions, or <br>SAP BTP Integration Suite – customers must monitor the integration themselves, a process <br>which SAP Cloud ALM can help them manage. <br>• Outlook for managing hybrid solutions: Customers adopting the Intelligent Enterprise <br>will see increased support for on-premise solutions like SAP S/4HANA. Monitoring the <br>integration of on-premise or other cloud products is an additional discipline SAP Cloud ALM <br>will focus on in the future. <br>Customers who subscribe to a cloud service from SAP that includes SAP Enterprise Support cloud editions <br>have access to SAP Cloud ALM at no additional cost. [Update 2022: Enterprise Support customers are entitled <br>now, too] <br>SAP is dedicated to simplifying and improving users' journeys to cloud-based solutions and supporting <br>companies of all sizes in their goal of digital transformation. In extending full ALM support, the current update <br>to SAP Cloud ALM takes an important step toward a more agile, innovative future. <br>Read more about SAP Cloud ALM<br><br>Page 17:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 17 of 66 <br> <br>3 Powered by CALM <br>Powered by SAP Cloud ALM is a new branding for onboarding new use cases on the SAP Cloud <br>ALM platform. We open our CALM platform to make integration and delivery easy for all development <br>teams of SAP (so not only CXS). By this reuse we can simplify customer experience and offer all-in-<br>one services under SAP Cloud ALM. This is the target of Powered by CALM  is enabling any <br>organization inside SAP to be part of one (or more) of the three delivery channels that are <br>Powered by SAP Cloud ALM. In combination, the channels simplify the user experience (for SAP <br>and Customers). <br>Three examples, one for each channel that we offer, are: <br>1. PALM: We target the broad adoption of SAP Cloud ALM (CALM) and continue to serve <br>our customers who have not yet onboarded and started their SAP Cloud ALM journey. <br>We solve this challenge by extending our platform to a new SaaS solution <br>named Public ALM (PALM). Our paved road approach helps to onboard scenario <br>owners to Public ALM, which is then accessible by our customers' Universal ID through <br>SAP for Me. Process Navigator by SAP (formerly known as Best Practice Explorer), <br>Readiness Check, Roadmap Viewer, and Fiori App Library are the first use cases on <br>the Public ALM infrastructure. Those scenarios offer an easy entry point for customers <br>and will guide them finally to onboard to a full CALM tenant: <br>2. CALM: SAP Business Transformation Center (BTC) gets part of the CALM delivery <br>channel. BTC customers will benefit from seamless integration with CBuild <br>implementation project capabilities. So, the business and data transformation/migration <br>from i.e., ECC to S/4HANA can be simplified based on Powered by SAP Cloud ALM. <br>Our customers will benefit from seamless implementation project capabilities to plan and <br>realize their data transfer from i.e., ECC to S/4HANA. <br>Readiness Check and Roadmap Viewer join beside PALM also CALM, reusing the <br>microservice for both channels. Onboarding Content Framework from the S/4 HANA team <br>will join CALM and integrate with the SAP Cloud ALM implementation project to guide the <br>customer with streamlined UX focusing on SME (small and medium-sized) customers. <br>3. XALM: Service Delivery for SAP employees serves via one cross-Cloud ALM (X-ALM) <br>tenant for all SAP-internal stakeholders from Premium Engagement, Preferred <br>Success, and Enterprise Support, who digitize, develop, and deliver services to all SAP <br>customers. The XALM tenant can collaborate with the customer users in the many <br>CALM tenants using event-based communication (seamless between the microservices, <br>across customer tenants, and even across data centers). This can be used to centrally <br>manage/author SAP content in XALM and then distribute the content to all customers in <br>CALM/PALM (content is distributed).  <br>Several microservices that are used for XALM are also used in the CALM delivery <br>channel, for instance, Service Delivery WorkCentre. – and all integrate with task <br>management that was initially created as a CALM-Build microservice. <br>As PALM, CALM, and XALM are built on the same platform, all teams benefit from the same proven <br>engineering principles, daily delivery, tools, and simplified processes that we invented for CALM - in <br>short, The Paved Road Approach . On top of being based on one standardized infrastructure and  <br>reuse services, the integration of scenarios across and within PALM, CALM, and XALM is simplified. <br>In sum, "Powered by SAP Cloud ALM" is more than its parts. All teams across SAP are welcome <br>to contribute application lifecycle-related capabilities. The Paved Road approach enables teams <br>to deliver innovation continuously and sustainably.<br><br>Page 18:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 18 of 66 <br> <br> <br>Figure 7 – Powered by SAP Cloud ALM Building blocks <br>The picture above shows significant building blocks and layers that constitute Powered by SAP <br>Cloud ALM concept/branding.  <br> <br>If a use-case should join PALM, CALM, XALM, or a combination of these, needs some <br>explanation: <br>1. Integration with PALM: External teams often join from the SAP for Me sphere, <br>needing a replacement for NEO or ABAP-based backend implementations. The teams <br>look for ways to implement business logic in the cloud (Java/Node.js) and use HANA-<br>based persistence. They need a reliable, fast, flexible delivery process and operations <br>model. <br>Hence, the likely starting point for them would be PALM. However, Powered by CALM <br>isn't limited to PALM. The microservices developed for PALM can also run in CALM <br>and XALM after minor adaptations that usually do not need a fork of services/repos <br>(e.g. can work with operation/configuration toggles). <br>Check the PALM wiki page for more details.  <br>Most applications that start in PALM will also want to join the CALM delivery channel: <br>2. RECOMMENDATION: Direct integration with CALM delivery channel: The teams <br>can join CALM directly without integrating with PALM (For example, the CLM Customer <br>Landscape App). <br>We target to guide all customers to their CALM tenant with the benefits of deep <br>landscape integration and a broader user base (not just restricted to ~500k S-Users <br>worldwide). In most cases, apps in PALM will have a considerable benefit when <br>deployed to CALM with a much deeper integration into the customer processes. We <br>aim to have the most customers in CALM in the next few years (all relevant 74.000 <br>customers are entitled already!). Reusing code/microservices across PALM and CALM <br>can mostly work (the main challenge will be the different user base and, hence, <br>authorization checks and the weaker data separation/security situation caused by the <br>shared cross-customer-account setup of PALM that is inherited by SAP for Me). <br>However, it is still an additional effort to operate and test. Therefore, a business <br>decision is made case-by-case if a PALM deployment in addition to CALM makes <br>sense. In many cases, a focus on CALM can be the better approach. <br>3. For scenarios that require collaboration between Customer and SAP, teams can <br>leverage the combination of CALM and XALM (see the Service Delivery use case).<br><br>Page 19:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 19 of 66 <br> <br> <br> <br>Figure 8 - Relation of SAP for Me, PALM, CALM and XALM.

SAP Cloud ALM's cloud native journey has been a success <br>story, continuously improving the solution and delivering stunning quality and innovation speed to <br>benefit SAP Cloud ALM customers. <br>The Paved Road Approach includes simplified processes, an agile toolset, and cloud engineering <br>with "daily" as the golden principle; defining the mantra of "automate all you can automate" reduces <br>manual toil for engineers, drives quality, and minimizes customer support tremendously, which then <br>leaves time and capacity for continuous innovation. <br>Details and the latest updates on Powered by SAP Cloud ALM: https://wiki.one.int.sap/wiki/x/64zNug<br><br>Page 20:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 20 of 66 <br> <br>4 Engineering Culture, Process, Tools <br>The SAP Cloud ALM Engineering Culture is based on Deploy with Confidence. An overview can be <br>found on the following slide: <br> <br>Figure 9 - Engineering Culture and Customer Experience <br> <br>Deploy with Confidence covers the whole process from Customer Requirement over build and test <br>to Operation. DwC Documentation: https://dwc.tools.sap  <br>Technology is an enabler to solve problems, but it's people who truly solve problems. This aspect is <br>often forgotten. DwC starts with the culture first, having three aspects: <br>Single Trunk (single code line): Eliminating long-living feature branches leads to massive <br>simplification in the development: You don't need double maintenance of the code. <br>Test and integration of the new code into one SaaS application happens faster and helps to get <br>immediate feedback on the current state of the application.  As a result, we see a reduction in <br>development complexity and, hence, costs. <br>When following the single trunk approach, we have to hide incomplete functionality from customers <br>behind a feature toggle. Thus, we end up with the second principle: <br>Release feature toggles: Patches and features are delivered in one unique codeline. Hence, there <br>must be other ways than branches to control the visibility of functionality for the customer users. <br>Release-feature-toggles are the means to control software release efficiently in a cloud-native <br>environment. <br>Daily Delivery to Production: Let us assume you need to deliver a critical bugfix. Of course, you <br>need to be able to provide it as soon as possible, and the reason is that our customers expect this.  <br>Therefore, the delivery is done at least daily (for urgent hotfixes, SAP Cloud ALM can deliver a<br><br>Page 21:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 21 of 66 <br> <br>change to production in 30 minutes, including end-to-end testing, deployment, and compliance). <br>This Daily principle drives the automation of testing and delivery activities. <br>These cultural principles have proven to be important success factors for companies like Google, <br>Netflix, and Amazon. <br> <br>Figure 10 - Cloud Engineering Culture at SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>The feature delivery frequencies at SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>Figure 11 - Feature delivery frequencies at SAP Cloud ALM<br><br>Page 22:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 22 of 66 <br> <br>4.1 Single Trunk Delivery Model <br>Into the single codeline, changes are frequently merged ("merge-to-main"). The visibility for customer <br>users (but also for testing) is controlled via release feature toggles. As the visibility of the changes <br>can be managed by toggles, the code can be released to production at any time. Hence, we do so as <br>this simplifies integration and lifecycle management processes. There is just one unified process for <br>feature delivery, bugfix, and hotfix needed. <br> <br>Figure 12 - Deploy with Confidence - Single Trunk and Daily Delivery <br>A detailed explanation of how Single Trunk fosters continuous integration is provided by Martin Fowler <br>at Continuous Integration (martinfowler.com). The article emphasizes the need to merge all changes <br>into the main branch often (at least daily). The daily delivery dashboard can be used to monitor how <br>long each commit takes to reach production. <br> <br>Figure 13 - Frequent merges to the main branch in DwC > Amalthea > Deliveries > Insights<br><br>Page 23:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 23 of 66 <br> <br>4.2 Release Feature Toggles <br>A Scrum Team (the PO usually) can decide to deliver functionality into production at any time (given <br>all product standards are checked automatically and automated tests assure stability).  <br>Making the new functionality visible to all customers might need to be done in a consolidated w ay <br>(Training effort, rollout, etc.). Details: https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html <br>That will also depend on the type of change you do. For E.g., a performance improvement can be <br>activated immediately from a Release-Management perspective. <br>The DwC Feature Cockpit helps to keep an overview of the toggles: Feature Toggles - Amalthea<br><br>Page 24:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 24 of 66 <br> <br>4.3 Daily Delivery to Production <br>Things you do more often create less stress than things you do only occasionally. <br>Only daily (or more often) delivery to production brings teams into a continuous, sustainable change <br>mode. Teams will use their engineering skills to automate the process. <br> <br>Figure 14 - Why daily? Big waterfall | small waterfall | no waterfall <br> <br>Our Mission: Build Great Software Faster. <br>Why build faster at all? Answer: Because our customers expect that from us! <br>By fast, we do not mean the number of lines of code that are produced by the engineering team. <br>And we also do not mean the number of features. These absolute numbers can be measured <br>easily, but they do not provide any information about the value for our customers. We focus on the <br>speed of the feedback loop with the customer and the users because this feedback loop allows us <br>to measure the value. That measurement is challenging, but the prerequisite is making a service <br>available to users. Once users can consume a service, usage measurements, net-promoter scores, <br>interviews about the experience, and more can be done. If a feature is implemented but not <br>delivered, there can be no value and no feedback! <br> <br>Growing the SaaS solution daily – The Solution Vector Concept <br>When the customer SaaS solution is updated daily, one needs a very robust update mechanism <br>with real zero downtime for the customer end users. There shall be no impact on any user session <br>on the update! This can only be achieved by being able to operate the old version and the new <br>(daily delivered) version in parallel for some time (lifetime of user sessions) <br>When a daily delivery is done for the day, the previous version is still active for end-users. In parallel <br>to the day-1 version, the new one is deployed and tested. Tenant Lifecycle activities like database <br>schema updates are performed. Once all is set, new user sessions can log in to the new version. <br>The new version is most likely slightly larger in code and feature set (feature toggles!). Only new<br><br>Page 25:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 25 of 66 <br> <br>user sessions will see that new functionality, including consistent switching of documentation, <br>authorizations, etc.  <br>We call the combination of toggle set, microservice versions, documentation, etc., a solution vector. <br> <br>The Confidence in Deploy with Confidence is about the Interface Compatibility between the <br>Microservices, their UI, and Database: Only complete Vectors and no Intermediate States need to <br>be regarded (Exponential Test Complexity otherwise!) (External APIs must be compatible, no <br>change here! > Versioned) <br>Google: "There is no compatible change. There is only change! And every change can break <br>something. Correctness is an illusion. Relevant is fitness for release." <br> <br> <br>4.4 Feature-Driven Development Process <br>Based on the cultural values, a cloud-native feature delivery process is defined.  <br>• It starts with the definition of a feature.  <br>• The features are developed behind a feature toggle and in a single codeline.  <br>• Fast and compliant build pipelines are very important to achieve daily delivery.  <br>• Fully automated end-to-end tests validate correctness from the customer's perspective. <br>• We activate features when we are ready and when it's best for the customers, no stress. <br>Quality first. <br>• After the features are activated, we can measure the usage and success of the feature and  the <br>value that the feature delivers for the customer. <br>All project members, including developers  ("engineers"), product owners, quality engineers, user <br>assistants, and so on, are involved in the feature-driven development process.<br><br>Page 26:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 26 of 66 <br> <br> <br>Figure 15 – Feature-Driven Development Process of SAP Cloud ALM at DwC <br> <br>As the process is essential to understand, here is a diagram with more details: <br> <br> <br>Figure 16 - Feature-Driven Development Process of SAP Cloud ALM at DwC - Details<br><br>Page 27:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 27 of 66 <br> <br>4.5 Feature-Driven Development Process at SAP Cloud ALM  <br>Based on the templates co -developed by DwC and CALM, SAP Cloud ALM has the following <br>landscape setup for the daily delivery process. <br> <br>Figure 17 - Deploy with Confidence - CALM Landscape Setup <br>More info on CALM@DwC Landscape Setup at https://wiki.one.int.sap/wiki/x/p02-fw  <br> <br>The feature delivery process at SAP Cloud ALM as a step-by-step guide: <br> <br>Figure 18 - Step-by-Step Guide for Feature Delivery  <br>Process details: https://wiki.one.int.sap/wiki/x/p16Ti<br><br>Page 28:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 28 of 66 <br> <br>4.6 Daily Delivery Process for CALM Engineers <br>There is a training session for new teams at SAP Cloud ALM: <br>Daily delivery Together: https://wiki.one.int.sap/wiki/x/DmSngw  <br>The session can be provided by the delivery team and shows how all engineers should work together <br>for high-quality and smooth delivery. <br>The promotion from development to production can be followed live via the Grafana Delivery <br>Dashboard: <br> <br> <br>Figure 19 - Promotion Flow of PALM, CALM, and XALM.  <br>Communication between engineers and delivery team: Follow Slack channel #sap-calm-delivery <br> <br>4.7 Engineering View on Tools for Delivery <br>Developers will work on their microservice GitHub repos. At SAP Cloud ALM , engineers can use <br>Visual Studio Code, SAP Business Application Studio, Eclipse, or IntelliJ. <br>Step 1: When a change of the microservice is ready from the developer's perspective, this change <br>can be merged to the main branch : The single trunk / main branch is updated. This should <br>happen at least once a day  to avoid big -bang merges, merge conflicts, long -living feature <br>branches, and hidden code. <br>Step 2: The merge will trigger the component build pipeline. Any build tool that can do SAP-compliant <br>builds (e.g. , xMake, including artifact upload to Nexus)  can be used . SAP Cloud ALM  <br>pipelines include many more steps for test automation, etc. These are independent of DwC.  <br>CALM uses Piper general-purpose pipelines as  templates and optimizes them for <br>performance and throughput. Several JaaS instances exist: SERVICE  CBUILD  BTC  CRUN <br>Step 3: One of the last steps in the pipeline is to inform the Deploy with Confidence infrastructure <br>about the successful build. This step will trigger the Deployment and Activation of the new <br>microservice version within the SaaS landscape. <br>Step 4: The pipeline trigger is received by Themisto, and it is evaluated where (in which stages and <br>spaces) the new version needs to be available . Themisto is also called "the brain" behind <br>DwC, as Themisto is responsible for calculating and triggering all needed landscape <br>changes. For instance , Themisto informs Autonoe about the required changes  and (not <br>depicted) also triggers a database schema lifecycle component called Euporie.<br><br>Page 29:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 29 of 66 <br> <br>Step 5: Autonoe takes care that the needed deployments (e.g. , via MTA Deploy), unemployments, <br>and routes are configured in SAP BTP Cloud Foundry. Cloud Foundry applications are <br>operated in different spaces to separate DEV/TEST/PROD from each other ( significant for <br>authorization management - not every Engineer should have access to productive customer <br>data). <br>Step 6: Once all deployments are done, Themisto gets the trigger to inform Jupiter about the new <br>Landscape vector that can be used by SaaS users. Jupiter is an extended Application router <br>that takes care to authenticate users and route access to the relevant apps in the appropriate <br>spaces. <br>Step 7: SAP Engineering can configure and control this flow with a visualization tool called Amalthea: <br>https://dashboard.dwc.tools.sap/org/CALM/landscape/overview  <br>The following figure shows the process across the DwC architecture. The image includes Cloud <br>Foundry deployment.

Live Site First <br>The imperative for the whole organization – including management: If the live site is down (or <br>related processes, like daily patch delivery, are blocked), there is no other activity more <br>important than bringing the service back up. <br> <br>2. Shepherd Your Change <br>As the developer of a feature, you are responsible for getting your feature to production, <br>including delivery and operations. <br> <br>3. Automation Is Key <br>Manual processes are error-prone, slow, and do not scale. Automation in testing, deployment, <br>and operations is critical for a cloud service at a competitive cost. <br> <br>4. Measure and Learn <br>Deliver often and learn from it. Constantly collect and proactively analyze metrics to gain <br>insights for the future backlog.<br><br>Page 31:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 31 of 66 <br> <br>These are sometimes too abstract rules. So, we have details of how exactly every CALM Engineer <br>can support these values. The rules are documented in  <br>Guidance for CALM Engineering - Engineering Excellence by Continuous Delivery to Production, <br>Daily <br>Rules include: <br>1. Care for CALM. We are all one SaaS solution. Act with care for the overall solution. Contribute <br>as a multiplier. Support the Carpe Diem Process. <br>2. Support the Daily Delivery - Monday to Thursday 08:20 - 10:00 CET a Level of Stability is <br>Required <br>3. Merge your branches to the main branch often. <br>4. Keep your component build pipeline green! <br> <br>As rules alone are not enough, we established an entity taking care of CALM: The Carpe Diem team <br> <br>Daily life in a live cloud-native environment creates daily opportunities but also daily <br>challenges. To simplify the lives of our Cloud Native Engineers and increase transparency and <br>collaboration, we will combine automation, daily checks, best practices, and a we-all-care-<br>together mindset. We all will be working together as ONE team globally and taking care of <br>each other – cross-location and cross-time zone – to ensure a smooth start of the business day <br>– no matter where and when.  <br>– Carpe Diem! <br> <br>Our wiki describes how the Carpe Diem team, the Manager on Duty (MoD), and the Scrum <br>team on Duty (SToD) work: https://wiki.one.int.sap/wiki/x/Y5V8hw<br><br>Page 32:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 32 of 66 <br> <br>5 Architecture Guiding Principles <br>This chapter lists the guiding principles for CALM architecture. Whenever we make architectural <br>decisions, we validate the decision options against these principles. <br>Based on these principles, many small and large architectural and design decisions are made. Many <br>of these decisions can be found in this ACD.  <br>As we are in a dynamically changing environment, we use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to <br>document decisions that are not inside this ACD.  <br>CALM ADRs: https://wiki.one.int.sap/wiki/x/-CHdtw  <br> <br>1. We do Software Engineering <br>We do Software Engineering: Programming a scaling product by many humans over time! <br> <br>Time <br>For the life span of the product, we must be able to change all aspects. CALM is there to last for <br>many years and decades, as the customer need for lifecycle support will likely not end. Hence, <br>CALM architecture and processes must be planned accordingly to be sustainable and changeable. <br>We do not provide just a PoC or Beta. We provide continuous, infinite innovation. <br> <br> <br> <br>For CALM, we decided on Software Engineering, hence the infinite game! Thanks, Simon Sinek, for <br>formulating that!  <br>We invest enough time into your culture, processes, and tools to enable your services to grow and <br>evolve! For instance, Daily Delivery guides us here. Can we deliver Daily efficiently  now and in the <br>future? If not, we invest in time.  <br> <br>Scale <br>Supporting all customer segmentations and sizes in all regions, 5-digit number of accounts <br>This support requires sub-linear scaling for any activity, especially human activity. <br> <br>Providing a scaling product over time is our core target and principle.  All other principles can be <br>mapped back to these core principles.<br><br>Page 33:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 33 of 66 <br> <br>2. Shift Left Principle <br> <br>Shifting left means doing any quality-related activity as early as possible in the development process. <br>As the earlier issues are found, the easier it is to fix them or even automatically avoid that they happen <br>in the first place. The earlier you can do a test (in the diagram left), the more efficient it becomes in <br>the long term. That's why it is called shift left.  <br>This finally brings scale as manual checks and operations can be avoided. <br>3. Suite of Microservices  <br>Applications SHALL be organized in microservices built around business capabilities; <br>communicate mostly asynchronous, stateless, and scalable. <br> <br>CALM is designed as a suite of microservices. Microservice guiding principles: <br>• Each service has a separate persistency that is usually not shared with other services <br>(resilience, decoupling, etc.). <br>• During runtime , the microservices are independent of the availability of the other <br>microservices; communication is done via synchronous APIs and (preferred) asynchronous <br>messages (events based on Kafka infrastructure). <br>• Communication from a UI SHOULD usually only need one "hop". Avoid synchronous <br>dependencies between microservices (resilience – if a consumed service is down, avoid that <br>the calling service is not available, performance) <br>• Favor asynchronous, message-driven communication patterns ( benefits are a flexible <br>process flow, components can be exchanged, and decoupling) <br>Note that there are still software lifecycle dependencies between the microservices. And since <br>asynchronous communication might take some time (in worst-case scenarios, where related service <br>has an unplanned downtime), these dependencies are living even longer  than in synchronous <br>scenarios.  <br>Example: There is a new text field in the Notification service that can be maintained by customers <br>via the Customer UI5 app. The text field is stored in the Product Management service. Already by <br>this simple example, these services (although decoupled from a runtime perspective) get very much <br>related on a semantical level: Only if the field is available in the notification and product service  then <br>the field should be offered to the customer (otherwise, a user would enter that field, but it cannot be <br>handled consistently). <br>This advanced dependency handling is supported by Deploy with Confidence. <br>SAP Cloud ALM microservices are reviewed by the architecture board. The review process <br>and list of microservices can be found at: https://wiki.one.int.sap/wiki/x/QNxxiQ<br><br>Page 34:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 34 of 66 <br> <br>4. Domain Driven Design and API-First Methodology <br>API first, Modeled Microservices and aligned Domain Models as best practices <br>This means APIs must be kept stable. <br>We strive for an aligned domain model for every development. <br>SAP Cloud ALM adopts the Domain Driven Design approach to understand and design domains and <br>bounded contexts. This is a prerequisite for us before the development design and implementation <br>phases can start.  <br>An API-first approach means that for any given development project, your APIs are treated as "first-<br>class citizens." Everything about a project revolves around the idea that the product and, hence, APIs <br>will be consumed by client applications. An API -first approach involves developing APIs that are <br>consistent and reusable, which can be accomplished by using an  API description language  to <br>establish a contract for how the API is supposed to behave.  Establishing a contract involves spending <br>more time thinking about the design of an API. It also often involves additional planning and <br>collaboration with the stakeholders , providing feedback on the design of an API before any code is <br>written. <br>Public CALM APIs have already been released in the SAP API Business Hub. API Roadmap. <br> <br>SAP Open Connectors can be utilized to connect SAP Cloud ALM. Open Connector is a component <br>of the SAP Integration Suite , which helps to interface various SAP and non -SAP products quickly. <br>SAP Open Connectors comes with a large catalog of pre-built connectors, including JIRA. An example <br>integration of SAP Cloud ALM with Jira is described in this blog. <br>Domain Driven Design approach and API-first methodology are detailed in the wiki page: <br>https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/x/dsj6q<br><br>Page 35:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 35 of 66 <br> <br>5. Testability <br>Choose architecture decisions that support good test coverage and simplify the setup of tests. <br>For example, we use the subscription model with the capability to have many independent test and <br>demo tenants for our end-to-end tests in CALM. To make that work, we use schema separation per <br>customer per domain (only exceptionally shared schemas across tenants are allowed). <br>Testability is relevant for the complete technology stack and on all layers of the test pyramid. <br> <br>Details see  <br>• E2E Test Wiki: https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/x/JPWJhw  <br>• Cloud Quality wiki: https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/x/Vwime  <br> <br>6. Secure by Default <br>Secure by Default: Built-in security is recognized as a key challenge. - No compromises!  <br>We got the feedback from Hacker Simulation: "We see security is already from a concept point of <br>view designed into the solution". This is what we head for and want to keep! <br>Technically, Legally, and Trust-wise, we need to ensure that customers can accept our architecture <br>and the risks.  <br>We follow the Secure Software Development and Operations Lifecycle: SDOL <br> <br> <br>7. Simplicity for Customer <br>A seamless, easy onboarding experience is needed. → We go the last mile (if needed, also for <br>other groups at SAP). For instance, CALM has its own automated onboarding process.

Consistent Architecture across Areas <br>Consistent architecture across markets is an asset.  <br>Similar things SHOULD be done the same way across the markets.  <br>We align and decide together (Identity, Launchpad, Landscape, Connectivity, Messaging/Eventing, <br>Onboarding, Commercialization Model, etc.) <br> <br>10. TCO <br>TCO is our TCO!  <br>Decisions must lead to the lowest possible infrastructure costs for customers and SAP. <br>We carefully monitor the TCO of SAP Cloud ALM and take active measures to optimize.

However, scalability and functional gaps are <br>huge. So, this event technology cannot be used for technical <br>integration communication as needed for Integration Monitoring, <br>Process Monitoring, etc. <br>So, we invented our own Kafka-based solution to connect managed <br>tenants with CALM using the app-to-app integration pattern. Kafka <br>allows scaling, buffering, and potentially logging (Event log <br>Architecture!) incoming and outgoing asynchronous messages. <br>Note: We strive for an event-based, asynchronous microservice <br>architecture. Ideally, synchronous communication between <br>microservices is to be avoided.  <br>Asynchronous replication of data is an accepted pattern in case it <br>supports decoupling of the services <br>Reuse Tools and <br>Guidance <br>Cross https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/x/H1W4eQ <br>provides details on application logging, performance measurement, test <br>automation, metering, security, scalability, analytics, Workflow, etc. <br>BTP Reuse Service <br>usage <br> The current list can be found at https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/x/8mBTg  <br> <br> <br>The following sub-chapters describe several of these decisions in more detail.<br><br>Page 41:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 41 of 66 <br> <br>6.1 Data Persistency: HANA Cloud as Default <br>The recommendation for "Build-on SAP BTP" products is to use HANA as the default database. We <br>follow this use-HANA guidance in SAP Cloud ALM Build, Run , and Cloud Service Delivery . HANA <br>Cloud is used for OLAP and OLTP-based data. <br>Large unstructured data BLOBs like attachments SHOULD NOT be saved into the HANA database <br>but into the SAP BTP document management service. <br>CDS Views/annotations are recommended to be used as an abstraction layer on top of HANA.  So, <br>we are more flexible in case a move to another database is needed or to enable local testing with a <br>database mock.  HANA-stored procedures can be used in case CDS modeling is not advanced <br>enough. <br>6.2 Data Separation in Customer Subscription Model  <br>In SAP Cloud ALM , data separation is implemented by using different database schemas per <br>customer and domain. CALM uses the recommended tenancy model of Schema Separation (=HDI <br>Container). See the architecture decision record at https://wiki.one.int.sap/wiki/x/MdOfuQ.  <br>The HANA service manager is used to create the corresponding HDI container automatically, <br>orchestrated by DwC. <br>For customer business data, schema separation (or HDI separation) SHALL be used. <br> <br>Figure 25 - Subscription Model with HDI Container - Simplified <br>To ensure resilience, we decided to have a separate HDI container per customer per domain. A <br>domain in this context is a set of logically bundled microservices (e.g., task management, change <br>management, integration monitoring, etc.). How the domains are modeled in detail is subject to the <br>Software Design Documents of the corresponding areas. <br>HDI stands for Hana Deployment Infrastructure and indicates that there is a bit more behind it than <br>just a database schema. <br> <br>The following figure shows the subscription, HANA Instance, and HDI container handling in more <br>detail.<br><br>Page 42:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 42 of 66 <br> <br> <br>Figure 26 - Subscription Model with HDI Container – Detail (Visio) <br>A. Each customer has their own separate global account for SAP Cloud ALM and subscribes <br>to SAP Cloud ALM into (usually one) sub-account. <br>For simplification reasons, just three single customer accounts (Customer A, B, C) and <br>CALM Subscription are depicted here. <br>B. Customers have multiple options for identity provider assignment. A corporate IDP can be <br>reused, or a separate BTP IDP can be provided (the latter is not depicted in the diagram). <br>C. SAP can have multiple demo accounts, too. Besides doing demos, this can be used for <br>testing purposes and for support reasons (reproducing errors of customer accounts) <br>D. All functionality is provided by the SAP CXS Provider Account. Resources like CPU, <br>Memory, and persistence are provided centrally, too. The customer accounts do not need <br>their own runtime quota. <br>E. All CXS applications are subscribed as one bundle (no individual selection of sub-services), <br>F. Data Separation by HDI container per Subscription-Tenant and Application area. <br>The colored boxes on the right with the title "HANA" in the Provider Account illustrate the <br>HDI container, which is created as a consequence of the subscription process.  <br>a. Each SAP HANA database instance is created manually by SAP in the provider account. <br>b. The size of an existing DB instance can be increased over time. <br>c. New DB instances can be created by the CALM Operations team to put new customers in <br>separate DB instances.  <br>G. Very restricted SAP user access  to the provider account (only for Update/Upgrade and in <br>emergency cases…) <br>H. Data Exchange with the CXS Service and Support Data Lake. The Data Lake gets data from <br>CALM Tenants, XALM, and any SAP Backbone infrastructure like Service Provider Cockpit <br>(SPC),<br><br>Page 43:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 43 of 66 <br> <br>The diagram shows how much focus we spend to keep the customers and their data separated as <br>much as possible – at a reasonable cost. <br>Reuse services like Workflow, etc.  SHALL  be checked not to violate that level of separation . The <br>assumption is that all BTP reuse services are multi -tenant aware and provide the proper level of <br>isolation. <br>6.3 Subscription Model <br>The customer consumes SAP Cloud ALM exclusively per subscription. There will be no software <br>deployment into any customer account. Th e license materials must be assigned to the global <br>accounts of the customer-owned SAP BTP Sub-Accounts so that the software can be subscribed to. <br>The complete costs are accumulated in the global provider account operated by SAP CXS.  <br>To better understand the BTP Subscription model, some introduction to the BTP Domain Model is <br>helpful:<br> <br>Figure 27 – SAP BTP Domain Model<br><br>Page 44:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 44 of 66 <br> <br> <br>Figure 28 – SAP BTP subaccounts and subscription from provider account <br> <br> <br>Figure 29 - Subscription Model (details see Jam) <br> <br>6.4 CALM@DwC Account Setup <br>Use the Amalthea Cockpit to check the different sub-accounts and spaces that are set up for CALM: <br>https://dashboard.dwc.tools.sap/org/CALM/landscape/overview  <br>CALM follows the standard recommendations of DwC for account setup.<br><br>Page 45:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 45 of 66 <br> <br>6.5 XALM - Cross Customer SAP Cloud ALM <br>Details: https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/x/lTz_nQ  <br>CALM is an external customer-facing solution; all applications and features are available for all <br>customers' tenants. <br>There are use cases where SAP-internal facing tenant(s) must be supported. SAP employees <br>need to access SAP-specific or internal tenants. Access to these applications and features must be <br>protected from external customers. And that access usually has the semantics to <br>manage ALL CALM customer tenants (across the various CALM data centers). Therefore, we <br>configured XALM: XALM stands for Cross - X Cloud ALM. <br>6.5.1 XALM Use Cases <br>There are several use cases from different SAP areas for cross-customer XALM accounts. Some of <br>the use cases are shown below. Major business requirements are from the Cloud Service Delivery <br>area, where SAP consultants deliver services based on check procedures and service definitions <br>created by service/content owners. Similarly , there are other areas where content is created, <br>managed, and distributed to CALM customers. <br>CALM Build <br>▪ Standard business process content <br>CALM Run <br>▪ Health Monitoring authoring <br>CALM Service <br>▪ Service Asset Maintenance <br>▪ Service Authoring <br>CALM Cross <br>▪ Project and Task management usage metrics extractors and SAP for Me Integration <br>▪ Central Job Status Management <br>▪ Cross Customer Analytics  <br>▪ Machine Learning – integration with Data Lake <br>6.5.2 BTP Space Setup for XALM <br>There is one shared ingress space for XALM and CALM in the EU20 data center (that will change <br>once DwC supports setting up Jupiter Instances per application CF space, then we will separate). <br>The spaces where the actual microservices are deployed are separated. So , XALM runs separated <br>from CALM even though both are deployed in the same DC. The reason is that we make sure that in <br>the EU20 data center, we already have a similar communication using external APIs like it is when <br>calling between EU10 and EU20.<br><br>Page 46:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 46 of 66 <br> <br> <br>Figure 30 - BTP Cloud-Foundry Space Setup for XALM and CALM in EU20 and EU10 <br> <br>In Amalthea, the setup looks as depicted below: <br> <br>Figure 31 - CALM Landscape Setup in DwC <br>The different types of services (A / B /C) are a logical grouping of where our microservices are <br>deployed. Details are described in the next chapter.<br><br>Page 47:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 47 of 66 <br> <br>6.5.3 XALM / CALM separation of features vie toggle  <br>Since we need different feature toggle set configurations in XALM and CALM, we need separate <br>landscapes with different software vectors. XALM Provider account has been configured in EU20.   <br>We have the following types of microservices:  <br>▪ Common in both internal and customer-facing scenarios <br>▪ Specific to XALM (internal) <br>▪ Specific to CALM (customer-facing) <br>This can be illustrated as shown below: <br> <br>A permanent feature toggle x_xalm_cross_customer_tenant has been created to protect XALM <br>and CALM features for microservices that are deployed in XALM and CALM . The following table <br>illustrates different deployment options:<br><br>Page 48:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 48 of 66 <br> <br>6.5.4 Data Separation in XALM <br>In XALM, discriminator column data separation is allowed: Discriminator column data separation will <br>be used in the SAP account, where data of different customers are persisted. In this account, only <br>SAP employees have access to the application. So, in one managed HDI container, data from <br>multiple customers is included. Still, per XALM tenant, one HDI container per domain is created. <br> <br>Figure 32 – XALM - Cross Customer account with Discriminator Column Data Separation <br>Architecture decision regarding tenant-specific HDI container model is documented in ADR: <br>https://github.tools.sap/CALM/design/blob/master/adr/adr-0190-hdi-schema.md. <br> <br>The diagram also shows the two ways to integrate XALM with the different CALM accounts:  <br>1. Asynchronous communication via our Kafka -based cross-data center communication <br>infrastructure. This is the preferred way for integration for messages up to 0.5 MB. <br>2. Synchronous calls using the DwC Internal API Users  (we use the X.509 compliant setup) . <br>We use this way only if asynchronous communication is not feasible.  <br> <br>6.5.5 Integration of XALM with CALM <br>XALM's target persona is the SAP internal employee. Related persons can be from  the service <br>delivery organization  and admin users who perform cross -customer operations , monitoring, and <br>further integration scenarios.  <br>XALM is not an isolated application. Several integration and data replication scenarios exist with SAP <br>Cloud ALM, SAP backbone systems, SAP for Me, etc. The below picture shows XALM communication <br>with SAP Cloud ALM and SAP Backbone systems:<br><br>Page 49:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 49 of 66 <br> <br> <br>Figure 33 – High-level block diagram: Integration CALM, XALM, SAP Support Backbone <br> <br>The below diagram shows the asynchronous Kafka-based Cross Datacenter Communication: <br> <br> <br>Figure 34 - Cross Customer Account Integration (wiki) <br>The diagram also describes a new way to integrate with SAP Managed Cloud services: App2App. <br>Details: https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/x/IaUzkg<br><br>Page 50:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 50 of 66 <br> <br> <br>Figure 35 - Integration CALM-XALM including data separation, subscription,… - Detail (Visio) <br>I. Synchronous API calls: Customer subscription tenants can exchange data with the central <br>XALM account. <br>J. The Central Services can access data from SAP Support Backbone.  <br>Preferred is access via technical user provided centrally (no need to have customers <br>maintain s-users manually in their provider account). <br>K. The central XALM account shall not be accessible by customer users for security reasons. <br>We separate customer-access use cases and SAP-internal user access. The main XALM <br>account with the cross-customer functionality of Service Delivery Cloud shall only be <br>accessed by SAP users, like CSMs (Customer Success Managers) <br>Here, SAP users see data that customer tenants actively push to SAP (customer needs to <br>opt-in to send data).<br><br>Page 51:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 51 of 66 <br> <br>L. Asynchronous messaging: Datacenter to datacenter exchange of events: Bi-directional Data <br>Exchange is possible via Kafka, e.g. , sending  a service result from the Service Delivery <br>central XALM services to the customer account. <br>M. The central services offer a cross-customer view by design. Therefore, in one HDI <br>container, there will be data of many customer CALM tenants (Discriminator Column data <br>separation). Still, we create for each XALM tenant an own HDI-container in XALM to allow <br>an easy test- and demo account setup. <br> <br> <br>6.5.6 Integration of XALM with SAP Support Backbone Systems <br>Integration of CALM with SAP support backbone systems is done via XALM tenants. From a security <br>point of view, we don't connect SAP support backbone systems directly to CALM tenants. <br>The service delivery center in XALM has integration with the ICP system, as shown below:  <br> <br>Service result in XALM has integration to CBX system as shown below:<br><br>Page 52:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 52 of 66 <br> <br>6.5.7 Integration of XALM with consumers like SAP for Me or Data Lake <br>Some use cases require the central collection and storage of CALM data in XALM . This is, e.g., <br>required to collect project data from the individual CALM tenants to provide the integration of this data <br>in SAP for Me or to do benchmarking across all customers in the Service & Support data lake. <br>To collect the data , we make use of Cross Data Center (CDC) Communication. Each change  of <br>project data in the CA-ANA microservice will trigger an event to be sent to a dedicated Kafka message <br>queue, which will then be forwarded to XALM via the CDC distributor component. The CDC Router <br>component in XALM receives the message and puts it into the XALM Kafka inbound message queue. <br>The microservice x-metrics-collector gets this message, parses it , and persists it in the cross-<br>customer HDI container, which is an HDI container per subscriber tenant model. On top, a REST API <br>is created that can be consumed by SAP for Me or by the Data Lake using the service key. <br> <br>Figure 36 – x-metrics-collector architecture<br><br>Page 53:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 53 of 66 <br> <br>6.6 PALM - Public ALM <br>Public ALM (PALM) is one of the building blocks of Powered by CALM. <br>There are use cases where a customer might not (yet) have their own SAP Cloud ALM tenant. A <br>significant driver use case of PALM has been Process Navigator by SAP (formerly called SAP Best <br>Practices Explorer). The main requirement consists of allowing S-users and P-users who are not <br>necessarily SAP Cloud ALM customer end users yet to access and navigate through various best <br>practices and business processes offered by SAP. This requirement is also aligned with the "off-<br>Neo" initiative. Another motivation of PALM is to provide an overview to S-users and P-users and <br>give a glimpse of the capabilities that they can get by subscribing to SAP Cloud ALM. Therefore, we <br>configured PALM, where P stands for Public ALM.  <br>Today, the SAP ONE Support Launchpad (in transition to SAP for Me) is positioned as a single-<br>entry point for support of all the SAP Customers using S/C/D/I/(P) users (hence Universal ID). <br>The entry point (UI) of all service/support-related apps should migrate from SAP One Support <br>Launchpad to SAP for Me. More information about the transition can be found here | recording. <br>Therefore, Public ALM will not be "visible" as a new product with its own launchpad to end users, <br>but PALM applications running in the PALM shell will be invoked by SAP for Me and displayed in an <br>iFrame. Several integration options between SAP for Me and PALM have been considered. The <br>decision to embed PALM applications in an iFrame in SAP for Me and not call them in a separate <br>browser window has been documented in the ADR-0600. <br>The picture below shows where the SAP Process Navigator, an example of a PALM application, is <br>planned to be integrated with SAP for Me, mainly in the Services & Support area. <br> <br>Figure 37 - SAP for Me integration area for PALM applications <br> <br>The header and the footer of the PALM shell are hidden. Other services like the Web Assistant, <br>Qualtrics, Search, and user settings will be triggered via the SAP for Me shell. Communication <br>between the PALM application UI and the SAP for Me UI will happen via events. <br> <br>Applications that are deployed in CALM and in PALM need to implement the usage of certain <br>features (e.g., Web Assistant, Qualtrics, Search) twice. This is needed because the standard shell <br>is used in CALM, whereas in SAP for Me, the applications run as iFrame within the SAP for Me <br>shell. The applications use a permanent feature toggle to differentiate whether they are running in <br>PALM or CALM. <br> <br>The following picture shows the integration of the PALM applications into SAP for Me. The PALM <br>shell uses a generic custom style sheet to run in the SAP for Me iFrame in a headerless mode. That<br><br>Page 54:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 54 of 66 <br> <br>means that the header and footer of the PALM shell are hidden. SAP for Me and PALM use the <br>SAP IDP (accounts.sap.com) for user authentication.  <br>The PALM shell is also responsible for collecting and submitting usage data via the usage data <br>collector microservice. Some generic KPIs like "DB memory consumption" and "Clicks per UI <br>component" are collected centrally by the usage data collector microservice. Application-specific <br>KPIs can be collected by the PALM applications using the metering library.  <br>Other services (like Qualtrics surveys, Search, or Web Assistant) that are included in the SAP for <br>Me header bar can be called directly by the PALM applications. <br> <br> <br>Figure 38 - SAP for Me integration area for PALM applications<br><br>Page 55:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 55 of 66 <br> <br>Should I migrate to SAP for me or PALM/CALM? <br>As explained before, the user journey can start in SAP for Me. However , how to implement UI and <br>Backend services differs. And one has the choice of implementing in SAP for Me directly or leveraging <br>PALM/CALM. <br>The following table shows some criteria to help you make this decision. <br>Implement on SAP for Me infrastructure  Implement on Powered by SAP Cloud ALM <br>(PALM/CALM) <br>• Tight UI integration with other SAP for Me use <br>cases is planned. <br>• From a call with Kristian about SAP for Me: <br>• Display-Framework is the focus - "SAP for <br>Me component model to simplify end-user <br>access" (SAP for Me team does not offer <br>backend business logic infrastructure; <br>business logic must be provided by the <br>teams, based on existing backbone assets <br>(like ABAP-based CB*, ABAP-based <br>W7*, ODP, ...)) <br>• SAP for Me is not meant as a general-<br>purpose platform. SAP for Me focuses on <br>oData V4 + SAP UI5  (and basic Java <br>backend) + D3 for graphics    <br>• For its own complex business <br>logic/backend, a team needs to handle its <br>own accounts, delivery process, <br>monitoring/operation of HANA, etc.  <br>• A clear business value for CALM  <br>• Not the new platform for pure pre-sales <br>positioning → That is SAP for Me <br>• Entered data can easily integrate with <br>CALM/XALM <br>• Will not break Cloud Native Pattern (e.g., Data <br>Separation) <br>• Improve development excellence (e.g., Daily) by <br>DwC development culture. <br>• Reduce operation costs by harmonizing on a <br>paved road. <br>• Continuous innovation culture/effort (no throw-<br>over-the-fence after one year of development) <br>• The need for strong data separation and <br>customer-managed keys can be fulfilled in <br>CALM. <br>• Long-term private cloud deployments might be <br>possible (CALM-only) <br>For PALM use cases, see https://wiki.one.int.sap/wiki/x/qM8-sg  <br>For more info on the account setup for PALM, see https://wiki.one.int.sap/wiki/x/ugKGsw  <br>For details on authorization management in PALM, see https://wiki.one.int.sap/wiki/x/uU-kwg<br><br>Page 56:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 56 of 66 <br> <br>6.7 Asynchronous Messaging and Eventing with Kafka <br>We adopt asynchronous messaging for all communications in CALM with Kafka as the messaging <br>broker. Our goal is to enable this for all our communication use cases within and outside of CALM.  <br>Adherence to this approach is the general architecture guidance, as this is important with our growing <br>number of tenants and the need for resilience and scalability with this growth. <br>Currently, we cover the following scenarios <br>• Service-to-Service communication between the services within a DwC -Vector version (and <br>also future versions of the vector).  <br>o Details: https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/x/ypPrhw  <br>• Cross data center communication enables communication across different CALM and XALM <br>provider accounts.  <br>o e.g CALM-EU10  CALM-EU20, XALM-EU20 CALM-EU10… <br>o Details: https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/x/mRFJmQ <br>• Application-to-Application Communication. <br>o e.g., Consume events that are received via CALM/XALM inbound APIs (e.g., metrics <br>sent by Ariba-managed tenant) <br>o Details: https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/x/IaUzkg <br> <br>Unified Kafka Library <br>CALM invests in an inner-sourced unified Kafka library to support the adoption  of asynchronous <br>messaging using Kafka, covering the above-mentioned scenarios in the context of DwC. <br> <br>Figure 39 - Unified Kafka Library – Mission <br> <br> <br>Figure 40 - Unified Kafka Library - Block Diagram<br><br>Page 57:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 57 of 66 <br> <br>6.8 Embedded Analytics in CALM <br>For operational reporting (analytics here is typically integrated/embedded into the SAP Cloud ALM <br>Applications), we reuse the data and CDS models as created by the transactional application use <br>cases. We typically share the same data model within one domain. The benefit is to avoid redundant <br>definitions of metadata and to ensure data consistency. <br>For complexity and cost reasons, SAP Analytics Cloud is not used for Embedded Analytics in CALM. <br>For analytics use cases that go beyond microservices and are not possible to integrate on the UI <br>layer, we collect the relevant data into a central analytics microservice. For instance, for CALM Build <br>Overview Page: <br> <br>Figure 41 – CALM Build Overview Page <br>Details: https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/x/ibZVfQ  <br> <br>6.9 SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC) – Integration Option <br>Customers who have their own SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC) tenant can use the SAP Cloud ALM <br>Analytics API that is published in the SAP API Business Hub. The SAP Cloud ALM Analytics API is <br>implemented as a service broker and provides a REST / oData API to access the CALM analytics <br>data. Customers need to first subscribe to the service broker and then create a service instance and <br>a service key in their CALM customer account. With this service key, they can create an oData Service <br>connection in their SAP Analytics Cloud tenant. The oData Service connection only supports data <br>acquisition, with no live connectivity. After customers create SAC models based on the SAP Cloud <br>ALM Analytics API, they can extract data from CALM and persist in their SAC tenant. <br>It's also possible to provide pre-built content that customers can access within the Content repository <br>within SAC (see also the Analytics Technology Guideline TG32).  <br>It would also be possible to embed SAC content directly in the CALM application, but this would <br>require automated SAC tenant provisioning. It was decided not to embed SAC content due to higher <br>TCO.<br><br>Page 58:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 58 of 66 <br> <br>6.10 Service & Support Data Lake <br>With the Service & Support Data Lake  platform, we want to provide data -driven innovations for our <br>stakeholders in Customer Solution Support & Innovation (CSI). The platform runs on Kubernetes on <br>Converged Cloud and includes several components to do data integration, machine learning, logging, <br>and provisioning of ML services for several applications. Service and Support data is extracted to the <br>Service & Support Data Lake and stored there for data exploration. The data is then analyzed by data <br>scientists, and ML models are created  based on the  CSI business requirements. These ML models <br>are exposed as  ML services and can then be consumed by the applications via the API Gateway <br>(Kong). <br> <br>Figure 42 - Service & Support Data Lake  <br>More information can be found below <br>• Recording of Service & Support Data Lake – introduction (BAM) <br>• Service & Support Data Lake Wiki page <br> <br>6.11  Metering and Usage Analysis <br>Within SAP Cloud ALM , we collect usage metrics to provide transparency about the adoption and <br>usage intensity of our product . This helps our product management make investment decisions as <br>well as the development to gain insights on how the individual parts of the product are used . In <br>addition, we use the usage data to integrate with CPEA for billing purposes (for the HDI container <br>usage as well as for external API consumption by customers). <br>For collecting the usage metrics in SAP Cloud ALM, we introduced a microservice called "Usage data <br>collector" that is responsible for collecting the usage data from the individual application microservices <br>via the metering library and sending them via the SAP M etering Service from BTP to the Cloud <br>reporting and CPEA for billing purposes (for those metrics that are billing-relevant). <br>The microservices can submit usage data regularly to the usage data collector. Alternatively, usage <br>data can be pulled by the usage data collector from the microservices via a job. The usage data <br>collector stores the usage data in a shared HDI container, and periodically, the usage data is sent to <br>the Metering service. Metering service then forwards to Cloud Reporting. In Cloud Reporting, there <br>is a spec ific dashboard with all usage data that is specific to SAP Cloud ALM.  There, additional <br>customer and tenant master data can be used to do data analysis. Also , other data sources (e.g ., <br>ServiceNow cases) are integrated with the CALM Cloud reporting dashboard.<br><br>Page 59:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 59 of 66 <br> <br> <br>Figure 43 – CALM Usage Measurement Architecture <br> <br>Customers who use more than 8 GB of HANA memory will be charged based on the additional HANA <br>memory usage. Therefore, we measure the HANA memory usage of all tenants on a monthly basis.  <br>As a prerequisite , customers who overuse 8 GB of memory need to subscribe to the SAP CALM <br>memory extension service in their CPEA account. Then, the usage data collector will send the usage <br>data of those customers associated with their CPEA account so that they can get charged based on <br>their usage. In the CPEA account, the customers see the HANA memory usage and the related costs. <br>In addition, the information about the HDI container usage is also sent to the health monitoring <br>application so that customers get  information about which application is using most of th e HANA <br>memory so that they can potentially do clean-ups if, e.g., data is not required anymore. <br>To ensure the data quality of the usage data, we use Focused Run. There, we defined rules (e.g., to <br>check the latest usage numbers against the standard deviation) and thresholds that can be used to <br>alert and notify the developers of potential issues. <br>Details: https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/x/-sjEfg  <br> <br>6.12  Backing Services and Scalability <br>SAP BTP / Cloud Foundry offers several backing services, which are being consumed by SAP Cloud <br>ALM. These backing services are generic services  and avoid the need for  every application to <br>implement such functionality on their own. Typical backing services are Cloud Logging, Audit Log, <br>Application Autoscaler, and the like. The list of the consumed backing services of SAP Cloud ALM  <br>can be found in the service toolchain application at <br> https://services.tools.sap/#/perspective/inventory/service/SERVICE-440 (tab "Required Services"). <br>The list is also maintained at https://wiki.one.int.sap/wiki/x/8mBTg. <br>The plan for SAP Cloud ALM is to finally have around 50.000 customers. We must be prepared for a <br>larger number of customers. Currently, around 74.000 customers are entitled to use SAP Cloud ALM. <br>Since we don't plan to run SAP Cloud ALM in one single data center exclusively, the assumption is <br>not to have more than 5.000 customers in one data center until 2024. <br>To handle 5.000 customers per data center, SAP Cloud ALM needs to ensure that the consumed <br>backing services scale accordingly and can handle the load. Missing scalability of consumed<br><br>Page 60:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 60 of 66 <br> <br>backing services will end up in showstoppers for the rollout activities for SAP Cloud ALM. There is a <br>separate workstream on performance and scalability.  <br>In the early days when the workstream was started, we had to look at the scalability of the backing <br>services by ourselves. We estimated the load per customer per day, and we extrapolated the load <br>accordingly. Based on this data, we check with the particular BTP service owners to see if the <br>service can handle the expected load. In August 2021, BTP Core (India) set up its own team to run <br>load tests based on our requests. The documentation of the tasks in this workstream is listed at <br>https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/x/9BHRiw. <br> <br>6.13  Identity and Access Management <br>SAP Cloud ALM is a customer-managed SaaS. T herefore, the customer is responsible for user <br>authentication. SAP supports the customer with best practices on how user authentication shall be <br>done. Note: Identity and Access Management is not the same as Authorization Management. <br>In the customer onboarding process, SAP Cloud ALM offers fully automated provisioning . The  <br>customer user who requested the SAP Cloud ALM tenant can log on to the application without further <br>configuration activities. So, the basic SAP BTP Cockpit configuration is done within the provisioning <br>automation. Additional configuration effort is required so all SAP Cloud ALM features  can be used. <br>Such configuration can include setting up connectivity to managed tenants and managed systems. <br>As part of the automated provisioning, the customer gets their own IAS tenant for authentication <br>purposes. If there is already a customer-owned IAS tenant, this tenant is reused. I f there is no <br>customer-owned IAS tenant so far, a new IAS tenant for the customer is created. If an existing IAS <br>tenant is used, it is ensured that the user who requested the SAP Cloud ALM tenant gets a user in <br>this customer IAS tenant. In case this user gets created in the customer IAS tenant, the user receives <br>an identity confirmation email. In case a new IAS tenant is set up, the user who requested the SAP <br>Cloud ALM tenant gets a user in this customer-owned IAS tenant , and in addition , this user is <br>maintained as administrator of this newly created IAS tenant. <br>There is a license bundling of the customer-owned IAS tenant and SAP Cloud ALM, so the customer-<br>owned IAS tenant is free of charge for the customer in the context of SAP Cloud ALM. <br>The process of adding customer users to the customer-owned IAS tenant is not part of the SAP Cloud <br>ALM process. Customers have several standard options: <br>• Maintain the users in customer IAS tenant manually <br>• Maintain the users in customer IAS tenant by replication from S/4HANA or by SFSF <br>• Any other option provided by IAS <br>The users of the customer-owned IAS tenant are available in SAP Cloud ALM and in the SAP BTP <br>Cockpit. In both places, authorization can be granted to these users. <br> <br>6.14  User Role Assignment (Authorization Management) <br>In every application, the capabilities of the application are protected by defined role collections and <br>scopes. In customer-managed SaaS applications, the applications provide the available role <br>collections as part of the deployment. Customers are allowed to create additional customer-specific <br>role collections to suit their needs. <br>In customer-managed SaaS applications, the user-role assignment is done in the SAP BTP Cockpit. <br>These SAP BTP Cockpit UIs are very technical and not intuitive. In addition, the list of available role <br>collections is a mix of SAP BTP Cockpit roles, SaaS application roles, and customer-specific roles. <br>For SAP Cloud ALM, the user who requested the SAP Cloud ALM tenant gets the "Global <br>Administrator" role assigned to SAP Cloud ALM. With this role assignment, the user is authorized to <br>execute all capabilities of the SAP Cloud ALM application.<br><br>Page 61:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 61 of 66 <br> <br>To overcome that usability restriction in SAP BTP Cockpit, SAP Cloud ALM introduced its own <br>microservice: https://github.tools.sap/CALMBuild/uam-userservice. This is a cross-application user <br>management application with excellent usability and is embedded in the SAP Cloud ALM <br>launchpad. That way, the user-role assignment maintenance can be done within the SAP Cloud <br>ALM application. Users will not need to use the BTP Cockpit. It is just a special role assignment of <br>the SAP Cloud ALM application. By that, we ensure the ability to separate the application business <br>administrators from the application technical configuration administrators.  <br>The user roles maintained by CALM uam-userservice are 100% compatible with the users <br>maintained in the BTP cockpit. The user-role assignment, which is maintained in the CALM uam-<br>userservice, is therefore visible in the SAP BTP Cockpit. <br>The UAM microservice UI is optimized for SAP Cloud ALM but could be used in other SaaS <br>applications as well. The SAP Cloud ALM-specific role collections are displayed in an intuitive UI <br>(see screenshot). Role collection assignment in the UI is ordered according to the capabilities in <br>SAP Cloud ALM. SAP BTP Cockpit-related role collections are hidden and cannot be granted to any <br>user in this UI. Additional application-related roles can be granted to users in the "Custom Roles" <br>section. The roles displayed here are either customer-specific roles or, in the future, roles from <br>additional subscribed applications like CIAS, CTMS, etc… <br> <br> <br>Figure 44 – User authorization maintenance in SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>The user role concept for XALM is described here: https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/x/lTz_nQ  <br> <br>No UAM Service in XALM <br>We decided to deploy only CALM microservices, which are strictly required in XALM. By that, we keep <br>XALM as "lightweight" as possible. Therefore, as of February 2022, UAM is not part of XALM. It's <br>been decided that XALM applications that need to access the first and last name of a given user ID <br>to get the list of users assigned to a role, etc., will implement the required capabilities through a new <br>library/microservice. <br> <br>6.15  SAP Cloud ALM Commercialization <br>The SAP Cloud ALM commercialization model can be separated into two parts:  <br>1. All order-2-cash-related process steps <br>2. The tenant provisioning process. <br>In this ACD, we focus on provisioning processes. The process steps for order -2-cash are not in the <br>scope of this document since they are bound to the SAP Cloud ALM Commercialization / Business<br><br>Page 62:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 62 of 66 <br> <br>Model. See also the figure below: the process marked in the orange boxes is related to the order-2-<br>cash process. The fulfillment order triggers the provisioning. The fulfillment order also takes care that <br>the technical installation number is created and that the iBase is updated accordingly. <br>https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/x/Azo2b <br>  <br> <br>Figure 45 – SAP Entitlement and Cloud Provisioning Process <br> <br>As shown in Figure 45, the fulfillment request triggers the provisioning of the customer tenant. Either <br>in the Service Provider Cockpit or in SAP BTP CIS (Commercial Infrastructure Services). Depending <br>on the product that is ordered by the customer and assigned to the Provider Contract, Cloud <br>Entitlement Set and Fulfillment Request. For a better understanding, we need to clarify the two cloud <br>product types of SAP: <br>1. SAP-managed SaaS Application <br>For an SAP-managed SaaS Application, the provisioning procedure is performed by the <br>Service Provider Cockpit.  <br>In an SAP-managed SaaS Application, the global account is provided by SAP, as well as <br>the IAS Tenant. The customer gets provided with his or her own subaccount, activates the <br>subscription, gets a user in the subaccount, and is notified by mail, which includes a link <br>that he or she can start working. <br>There is no access to any SAP BTP administration tool (SAP BTP Cockpit) to manage <br>destinations, user-role assignments, and other tasks. Hence, these need to be provided in <br>the application. The customer does not even know that the application runs on the SAP <br>BTP environment. <br> <br>2. Customer-managed SaaS Application <br>For a customer-managed SaaS Application, the provisioning procedure is performed by <br>SAP BTP - CIS <br>In a customer-managed SaaS Application, the customer has full control of his SAP BTP <br>Account. Therefore, the provisioning creates a customer-owned global account (if there is <br>not already an existing global account), assigns an entitlement (the license material that is <br>ordered by the customer in the order-2-cash process) to the global account, adds the user <br>of the contract as admin user to this global account, and notifies the user via mail (with link <br>to SAP BTP Cockpit) that all other tasks need to be done manually.<br><br>Page 63:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 63 of 66 <br> <br>For SAP Cloud ALM, the customer needs full access to the SAP BTP Cockpit to maintain the <br>destinations to the customers' cloud tenants as well as to the customers' on-premise systems. Only <br>a customer-managed SaaS scenario offers this type of access to the customer landscape. Hence, <br>SAP Cloud ALM uses the customer-managed SaaS model. <br>6.16  SAP Cloud ALM Customer Onboarding <br>All customers with a valid Enterprise Support contract or higher (MaxAttention, Preferred Success, <br>and the like) are entitled to request a n SAP Cloud ALM tenant. For all these customers , there is an <br>SAP Cloud ALM-specific entitlement set (see Figure 23). All in all, about 74.000 customers are entitled <br>to request an SAP Cloud ALM tenant. <br>For details about commercialization, see https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/x/Azo2b. <br>Since we don't want to create 74.000 SAP Cloud ALM tenants, and the customer might not even use <br>their SAP Cloud ALM tenant, it was decided to go for a manual call -off to get an SAP Cloud ALM <br>tenant provisioned.  <br>The currently available application to trigger the call-off is ONE Support Launchpad (OSLP). See the <br>figure below:  <br> <br>Figure 24 – SAP Cloud ALM Call-off application in OSLP <br>The admin user of a customer is allowed to request an SAP Cloud ALM tenant. In this application, <br>the customer admin user must specify the hyperscaler region (e.g ., AWS Frankfurt or Azure <br>Amsterdam) and the subdomain of the customer BTP subaccount, where the SAP Cloud ALM <br>application will be consumed. <br>By April 2022, this SAP Cloud ALM call-off application will also be available in SAP 4 Me as part of <br>the overall call-off application, where the customer user requests the call -off for all the customers' <br>cloud tenants. <br>Every call-off request is persisted in  the SAP Support Portal backend system for customer call -off <br>logging purposes and even more for provisioning monitoring purposes. See the figure below:<br><br>Page 64:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 64 of 66 <br> <br> <br>Figure 25 – SAP Cloud ALM provisioning monitoring <br>When the call-off request is persisted in the SAP Support Portal, the trigger in the ICP fulfillment order <br>is called to start the provisioning. The provisioning for SAP Cloud ALM is highly automated  to keep <br>the manual configuration steps for the customer after the provisioning at a minimum. Technically, the <br>provisioning procedure consists of 2 parts: one part in CIS and one part in SPC.  <br>In detail, the steps in the provision are: <br>• (CIS) Create one global customer account <br>• (CIS) Assign the entitlement for SAP Cloud ALM  <br>• (CIS) Assign the customer user from OSLP who requested the SAP Cloud ALM tenant  as <br>admin to the global account <br>• (SPC) Create a sub-account <br>• (SPC) Activate the subscription <br>• (SPC) Assign the customer IAS tenant (usually a customer has only 1) to the sub-account (or <br>create a new customer IAS tenant) <br>• (SPC) Create the first user in the IAS tenant (the customer user from OSLP who requested <br>the SAP Cloud ALM tenant) <br>• Assign the Global Administrator role collection from SAP Cloud ALM to the user  <br>• Send a mail to the user with the URL to the application and the URL to the SAP BTP Cockpit <br>After this provisioning, the customer user who requested the call -off in OSLP  is enabled to <br>authenticate at the customer's IAS tenant and start working with SAP Cloud ALM. <br>Technically, when the SAP Cloud ALM tenant provisioning is finished, a new entry is available in the <br>CLD of the SPC, which is replicated into the customer system data store in the SAP Support Portal. <br>This new tenant, together with the customer's call-off request, is the basis for the monitoring of the <br>SAP Cloud ALM provisioning shown in Figure 26. <br>Currently, the SAP Cloud ALM license material is maintained (in CIS) to allow only one subscription <br>per global account. This means the customer is allowed to create additional sub-accounts in the <br>customer's global account, but SAP Cloud ALM can be subscribed only once. This is at least the <br>current status but is subject to change. Depending on requirements from SAP Cloud ALM product <br>management or technical requirements (e.g., for the tenant to move from one data center to another <br>one), the number of allowed subscriptions might change. <br>In addition, there are ongoing discussions that there will be a combined provisioning of SAP Cloud <br>ALM in the context of SAP S/4HANA Cloud and SAP SuccessFactors tenant provisioning.  <br>6.17 Hyperscaler Strategy / Region Strategy <br>The current roadmap for hyperscaler / data center support is listed can be found in <br>https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/x/5ZPNj<br><br>Page 65:<br>Architecture Concept: SAP Cloud ALM <br> <br>© Copyright SAP SE 2023 Internal Page 65 of 66 <br> <br>6.18  DevOps and Operations Processes <br>For an introduction to CALM DevOps, see the following links: <br>• Engineering Excellence by Continuous Delivery to Production, Daily <br>• Carpe Diem - A Day in the Cloud <br>• For 24x7 operation processes and tools, see sub-pages of SAP Cloud ALM Operations  <br>(owned by CALMs 24x7 operations team).  <br>• See also Chapter 4.8 - Tools for DevOps Monitoring <br>• Special interpretation of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE): SRE@CALM wiki <br> <br>6.19  PPMS Model <br>SAP Cloud ALM, with its three sub-areas Build, Run, and Service, are handled as one PPMS product <br>(with three separate software components): <br> <br>Figure 46 - PPMS view on SAP Cloud ALM (link) <br> <br>6.20 Product Standards  <br>There are no special product standards for SAP Cloud ALM Build, Run , and Service Delivery.
