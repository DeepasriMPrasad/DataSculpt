For dedicated use cases, certain <br>exceptions are acceptable, but require good rea -<br>soning and a conscious decision from the respon -<br>sible engineering teams. The teams concerned <br>need to both be aware of the long-term conse -<br>quences and accept the implications regarding <br>any future evolution, roadmap investments, and <br>daily operations. <br>This North Star Architecture document is based on <br>the 2023 SAP strategy paper and complements <br>and updates previous North Star Architecture doc-<br>uments. Its content is based on the alignment work <br>of the Cross-Product Architecture  (CPA) working <br>groups.<br>The CPA collaboration model was established in <br>2021 to ensure that technology development is <br>well aligned between technology consumers, pri -<br>marily our lines of business (LoBs) and technology <br>providers, which are typically teams within the <br>Business Technology Platform (BTP) and some -<br>times service providers from other organizations. <br>CPA focuses on improving integration between <br>SAP services and standardizing SAP technology <br>components where appropriate. The North Star <br>Architecture became an integral part of CPA, as it <br>provides inputs and guardrails that are then <br>detailed out by the various CPA working groups. <br>This document also considers the strategic direc -<br>tion from the Cloud Delivery Architecture  (CDA) <br>group, which was created in 2023 to drive cloud <br>delivery efficiency along the three dimensions of <br>“Cloud Delivery Financial Operations”, “Cloud <br>Delivery Process and Tools Efficiency” and “Cloud <br>Delivery Architecture Optimization”. In addition, <br>this document puts emphasis on achieving various <br>cloud qualities and reducing total cost of opera -<br>tions (TCO) of our cloud services. The document is <br>not meant to replace the Product Standards , CPA <br>working group documents , or requirements from <br>the Technology Guidelines (TGs).<br>This North Star Architecture document does not <br>provide detailed coverage of all aspects of soft -<br>ware architecture. It focuses on the architecture <br>topics that are most relevant and impactful for <br>SAP in the near and mid-term future. In addition, <br>certain important cross-cutting aspects are not <br>discussed in dedicated chapters in this document <br>but are addressed across multiple chapters. For <br>instance, security is a core value for SAP and is <br>integral to all our products. Therefore, the concept <br>of "shift left," which involves incorporating security <br>capabilities automatically and transparently <br>through well-defined processes and tools (such as <br>hardened images), is discussed in the “ Business <br>Application Development” chapter as an example. <br>Similarly, the topic of asset management is briefly <br>mentioned in the “Cloud Delivery and Operations” <br>section. The same approach has been taken for <br>other crucial cross-cutting architectural aspects <br>like reliability and resiliency.<br>In the following nine chapters, which are struc -<br>tured into overarching topic areas, this document <br>describes SAP’s strategic direction.<br>The North Star Architecture document gives guidance for the most strategic <br>architectural topics at SAP. It provides technical recommendations, engineering <br>principles, architecture guardrails, and best practices for applications and <br>services, addressing a time horizon of three to five years.<br>Introduction<br><br>Page 4:<br>2 | 21<br>North Star Architecture Strategy 2024<br>INTERNAL – SAP  Only<br>Our goal is to enable all SAP products to contribute to a seamless <br>user experience that provides value to our customers by being integrated, <br>consistent, intuitive, insight-driven, and is implemented in a cost-efficient way. <br>To realize this, we must deeply understand the <br>user’s needs. Only then can we design and develop <br>the right user experience that will excite customers <br>and makes SAP attractive and competitive in the <br>market. The user experience of our products must <br>also become more tailored to role-based use cases <br>and offer personalization for end user needs.<br>To deliver on this goal, all products must comply <br>with the existing product standards, most promi -<br>nently Product Standard UX Consistency (UXC) and <br>Product Standard Accessibility. Furthermore, devel-<br>opment teams need to consider the following strat-<br>egies and guidance:<br> • ONE Design System: We must further harmonize <br>application design while providing an inclusive, <br>customer-first approach to designing and devel -<br>oping at SAP. The SAP Design System is SAP’s <br> unified design system. All web and mobile appli-<br>cations across our product portfolio must adopt <br>these concepts and adhere to them to ease the <br>overall implementation and foster out-of-the-box <br>consistency (see enablement guide). Established <br>design guidelines such as Fiori Design Guidelines <br>for Web and BTP UX Toolkit are already built on <br>cornerstones like UXC and are being consoli -<br>dated into a single SAP Design System Portal to <br>provide guidance for components, patterns, floor-<br>plans and even CLI. To enhance and broaden our <br>SAP Design System, we are transitioning to an <br>InnerSource contribution model across all prod -<br>ucts managed by Core Design.<br> • UI Component Strategy: To enhance UX consis-<br>tency across applications, we are further harmo -<br>nizing a growing list of technology agnostic <br> commonly used components. Accordingly, we are <br>extending our UI Technology strategy by offering <br>User Experience<br>SAP Web Components for general reuse across <br>different UI technologies (e.g., SAPUI5, React, and <br>Angular), improving developer efficiency and <br>ensuring consistent enterprise qualities. Lastly, <br>the creation and contribution of domain-specific <br>web components will be further streamlined <br>through the Hyperspace Paved Road for SAP <br>Web Components.<br> • User Insights: To measure success, product <br>teams must collect user insights through a UI con-<br>text-aware Product Experience (PX) Integration <br>(TG17 – User Insights ) by embedding standard -<br>ized Qualtrics surveys. Improvements can also be <br>analyzed with the BTP UX Deep-Dive Dashboard <br>(T&I) and the Voice of the User Dashboard (PE).<br> • Mobile Experience and Mobile  Technologies: <br>Mobile applications must be built with SAP Mobile <br>Technologies (e.g., SDK, MDK) using Mobile ser -<br>vices ( TG44 – Mobile Technologies ). With these <br>technologies, SAP, customers, and partners can <br>find clear guidance on how to rapidly build enter-<br>prise-grade mobile solutions. Mobile applications <br>must also follow SAP’s mobile design guidelines.<br> • Digital Assistant (Joule): For the conversational <br>experience SAP’s Digital Assistant (Joule) must <br>be embedded throughout SAP’s cloud portfolio, <br>delivering contextualized insights. AI UX guidance <br>is constantly growing as we learn and iterate. <br>We are building an integrated platform experi -<br>ence fueled by SAP Kernel Services  to provide <br>consistent access to the same functionality across <br>all SAP products, following platform experience <br>design guidelines. Every product must integrate <br>with these services to enable a common set of UX-<br>related capabilities.<br><br>Page 5:<br>3 | 21<br>North Star Architecture Strategy 2024<br>INTERNAL – SAP  Only<br>User Experience<br>Our end users often rely on various products and <br>applications during the execution of their business <br>processes. To ensure the best possible support for <br>our users, all products for business users must inte-<br>grate with SAP’s central entry points  ( TG01 – <br> Central Entry Point and Cross Product Navigation), <br>i.e., SAP Start or SAP Build Work Zone editions. <br>These provide simple and intuitive access to appli-<br>cations, tasks, processes, and information across <br>all SAP products through one underlying common <br>platform. To enable central entry points, products <br>must integrate with kernel services like SAP Build <br>Work Zone foundation:<br> • Deep Linking: Deep linking capabilities enable <br>cross-product navigation. Products must support <br>deep linking (TG01.R1 – Support Deep Linking) to <br>allow direct navigation from central entry points <br>or product entry points.<br> • Content Integration: Products must evolve to <br>become content providers ( TG01.R2 – Integrate <br>with Central Entry Point) by utilizing the Common <br>Data Model Replication API to allow for content <br>aggregation in business users’ central entry <br>points. Essential integration content like business <br>applications and deep links are shared via the <br>Work Zone platform while assuring a product’s <br>technical autonomy.<br> • Interest Cards: Integrating with the Interest Card <br>Service ( TG01.R4  – Integrate with Interest Card <br>Service) allows SAP business solutions to provide <br>consistent, up-to-date information to their busi -<br>ness users through SAP’s central entry point <br>solutions.<br> • Tasks: Kernel service SAP Task Center ( TG13 – <br>One Inbox) provides a single task inbox for web <br>and mobile that enables customers to process <br>tasks in a streamlined manner.<br> • Notifications: Integrating with Notifications  Kernel <br>Service allows products to make users aware about <br>situations that require timely action or attention. <br>Notifications are delivered over various channels – <br>web app, mobile, email, messaging apps, etc. <br>To stay competitive and optimize R&D costs, SAP <br>constantly enhances its UX platform capabilities. <br>Further steps in that direction include the harmo -<br>nization of user settings, standardizing themes, <br>and centralizing navigation.<br>In addition to enhancing the business user experi -<br>ence, we put high emphasis on optimizing the user <br>experience for administrators and developers:<br>The journey for administrators begins with their first <br>interaction as potential customers. We’re refining <br>the user experience from the moment customers <br>initiate their first SAP solution rollout, including trial <br>or freemium offerings, up to the complete lifecycle- <br>and landscape management for all their SAP solu -<br>tions. We envision a SaaS user experience that <br>empowers customers to focus on their businesses <br>rather than on IT infrastructure management. <br>Through holistic landscape management, we intend <br>to help customers maximize the value of their SAP <br>solution. Customers will be able to manage all their <br>SAP solutions as part of their entire IT landscape, <br>whether they prefer an interactive user interface, a <br>command line interface, or automation tooling for <br>this purpose. More insights about our technical <br>approach can be found in the chapters on <br> Integration and Business Technology Platform.<br>Transitioning to developers, we understand that UX <br>transcends beyond graphical user interfaces and <br>covers the entire interaction framework. To fuel <br>innovation and evolution in solutions, it is impera -<br>tive to provide a consistent and harmonized API <br>ecosystem around our products. This requires a <br>deeper exploration beyond fundamental API pat -<br>terns and general concepts for our APIs across all <br>SAP solutions (TG03 – Aligned Business APIs). We <br>must design these APIs with both a service provider <br>mindset and a focus on our consumers’ use cases. <br>We’re further witnessing a change from command-<br>based interaction to intent-based outcome specifi-<br>cations. The interface design needs to empower <br>developers to state their outcome (conversational/<br>prompts) rather than navigate complex options.<br><br>Page 6:<br>4 | 21<br>North Star Architecture Strategy 2024<br>INTERNAL – SAP  Only<br>While we are committed to providing an open, extensible, and heterogeneous <br>ecosystem of tools and services to internal and external developers, we need to <br>improve developer efficiency through harmonization, consolidation, and more <br>guidance. <br>A major cornerstone of SAP’s success was the abil-<br>ity to provide a coherent development platform <br>for building business applications in a highly cost <br>and time-efficient way. Business application devel-<br>opers were able to focus solely on solving busi -<br>ness-related problems by writing business logic <br>rather than being sidetracked by the need to <br>decide among and integrate with a wide range of <br>different technical and infrastructure services and <br>frameworks. <br>The primary measures of efficiency are the total <br>cost of research and development (TCD) and the <br>total cost of (cloud) operations (TCO). TCD encom-<br>passes all costs related to the design and devel -<br>opment of the software, including design, imple -<br>mentation, testing, and bug fixing. TCO includes <br>the cost for operating and supporting the applica -<br>tion. It also refers to efforts for customers to imple-<br>ment and operate a solution. Development teams <br>need to optimize for both by adhering to the fol -<br>lowing guidance:<br> • Reduce the overall heterogeneity and <br> complexity of technology stacks within SAP. <br>This internal harmonization will help us optimize <br>costs by reducing redundant development and <br>maintenance efforts. Instead, all development <br>teams need to proactively seek more reuse. Less <br>variation and more focus will also foster <br>innovation.<br> • Expedite the adoption of central services  (by <br>implementing Technology Guidelines ). Kernel <br>Services, Unified Services , and others provide <br>standardization, drive reuse, and facilitate seam -<br>less and uniform application integration. They <br>contribute to meeting our TCO targets and our <br>overall quality criteria by having specialized <br>teams focusing on cloud qualities and product <br>standard compliance. Central services consis -<br>tently provide reusable, high-quality capabilities <br>to all business applications. The services relieve <br>application developers of solving technical <br>problems beyond specific business require -<br>ments. Apart from a technical scope, Unified Ser-<br>vices also cover aspects such as commerciali -<br>zation. They facilitate the move from a <br>sub scription-based to a consumption-based <br>commercial model (as described in the Commit-<br>to-Consume strategy), which typically requires <br>significant architectural changes. Unified Ser -<br>vices (e.g., Unified Account) centrally provide a <br>flexible and solid foundation so that future <br>changes of commercial aspects have fewer <br>implications for application and service provid -<br>ers. This foundation will also be an important <br>enabler for an open SAP partner ecosystem by <br>reducing the technical integration effort on the <br>partner side.<br> • Use SAP’s opinionated development models <br>tailored to business application developers.  <br>Developers should focus on business logic <br>rather than on boilerplate activities and code. <br>Development models such as the SAP Cloud <br>Application Programming Model (CAP) and <br>ABAP Cloud, comprising the ABAP RESTful <br> Application Programming Model (RAP), are the <br>default choice for application teams.<br> • Adopt standard development processes. SAP <br>Hyperspace offers a standard process frame -<br>work for developing and delivering compliant, <br>secure, and high-quality enterprise software. <br>The provided templates and tools, such as <br>Business Application Development<br><br>Page 7:<br>5 | 21<br>North Star Architecture Strategy 2024<br>INTERNAL – SAP  Only<br>preconfigured and secure CI/CD pipelines, <br>Golden Images, Cloud Native Buildpacks, etc. <br>enable developers to focus on core develop -<br>ment tasks rather than “reinventing” custom pro -<br>cesses and tools. Hyperspace also provides <br>Paved Roads, which compile best practices and <br>provide guidance that can be leveraged by <br>developers through the Hyperspace Portal to <br>ensure secure-by-default SAP Cloud products <br>and deployments to the cloud.<br> • Follow best practices and prescribed <br>defaults. The Golden Path (internal)  and the <br>BTP Developer’s Guide (external), both driven by <br>the CPA WG “Cloud Development”  and aligned <br>across other related WGs, provide the go-to <br>architecture for the majority of BTP-based busi -<br>ness applications. The Golden Path contains an <br>architecture blueprint with a curated list of ser -<br>vices to integrate with, provides guidance for <br>software development and delivery processes, <br>and gives instructions on how to deliver on cloud <br>qualities and Intelligent Enterprise Suite Quali -<br>ties. It is equally important to follow the guid -<br>ance on Optimizing Cost for Cloud Development <br>and Operations. This guide provides an overview <br>of basic principles for reducing costs by making <br>TCO a primary architecture and decision driver <br>throughout the whole development process. As <br>we can only optimize what we can measure, <br>more data points and insights will be needed to <br>monitor and drive cost optimization. While teams <br>can already address this today by implementing <br>TCO-tailored logging and metering, a regular <br>analysis of their workload, and a proactive moni -<br>toring of resource utilization, we aim to also pro -<br>vide more central support through, e.g., cost <br>optimization dashboards, etc. The integration of <br>AI capabilities into our development tools will <br>also help drive the implicit adoption of develop -<br>ment best practices and defaults.<br> • Support collaborative development by apply-<br>ing Open Source ( SAP Open Source Manifesto ) <br>and InnerSource. Establishing InnerSource, which <br>is the application of methodologies and best <br>practices from open-source communities to in-<br>house software development, will improve devel-<br>opment efficiency and productivity. It also  fosters <br>reuse and reduces redundant development <br>because teams can influence/extend reuse <br> components with their own contributions.<br>Business Application Development<br><br>Page 8:<br>6 | 21<br>North Star Architecture Strategy 2024<br>INTERNAL – SAP  Only<br>It also aims to provide capabilities to integrate with <br>third-party solutions so they can bring their data <br>into the SAP data landscape, as well as giving them <br>the ability to consume SAP data products while <br>complying with data protection and privacy laws. <br>SAP’s data architecture is based around a set of <br>applications needed to collect, manage, store, <br>and process data. For more information, see “Data <br>Platform – Architecture“.<br>With regard to data persistence, SAP HANA Cloud <br>forms the core of our data architecture. It has <br>expanded beyond the original in-memory data -<br>base to include data on disk and data persisted in <br>low-cost cloud object stores. HANA Cloud and <br>HANA Cloud Data Lake instances can be deployed <br>together or separately by LoBs when and where <br>needed. With the focus on multi-tenancy, cost <br>reductions, and scalability, HANA Cloud must be <br>the default database, not just for all new cloud <br>applications for transaction processing and ana -<br>lytics, but also for decomposed (micro) services <br>as outlined in an ADR for HANA Cloud . In addition <br>to new applications, it is expected that cloud <br>applications running on HANA 2.0 on-prem ver -<br>sion should migrate to HANA Cloud. What’s more, <br>in many (but not all) cases, existing applications <br>running on third-party databases will benefit from <br>moving to HANA Cloud as outlined in the HANA <br>Cloud ADR. HANA Cloud Data Lake also provides <br>a low-cost and scalable data lake storage that can <br>be accessed directly from HANA Cloud via both <br>federation and replication.<br>On the compute front, Spark Compute  is to be <br>leveraged for scalable, powerful data engineering <br>and AI, operating against data in the HANA Cloud <br>Data Lake. Spark jobs are used to cleanse, refine, <br>and derive data, producing Data Products  that are <br>designed for consumption. SAP has partnered <br>with Databricks to use their managed Spark ser -<br>vice, tightly integrated with the HANA Cloud Data <br>Lake, with all data persisted in the HANA Cloud <br>Data Lake. To mitigate the risk of being fully depen-<br>dent on third-party technology, an in-house-  <br>managed Spark service has been built in parallel <br>as part of SAP HANA Cloud. The HANA Cloud <br>Spark service is initially only being used in the Pro-<br>curement data platform but is expected to extend <br>to other use cases in the future.<br>SAP Datasphere  (formerly known as Data Ware -<br>house Cloud with additional data integration fea -<br>tures) provides data mart capabilities in support <br>of analytics (including cross application) and cus -<br>tom data modeling. It also provides data integra -<br>tion tools that can be used in conjunction with or <br>independently of the data mart. Datasphere is <br>being enhanced to provide simple consumption of <br>Data Products, as well as the ability to publish <br>derived Data Products.<br>For data visualization and planning, SAP  Analytics <br>Cloud (SAC) is the strategic technology choice for <br>both standalone and embedded analytics, see <br>TG32. SAC OEM (the embedded version, for <br>embedding in SAP applications), is being enhanced <br>with a lightweight viewer to improve performance <br>and a shared application tenant to reduce cost. <br>Fiori/UI5 controls are also a lightweight low-cost <br>option for embedding individual analytic controls <br>in an application.<br>For distributed data platform architecture, Data <br>Products are the cornerstone, as they enable <br>sharing data across domains and application <br>boundaries. SAP applications, as well as customer <br>and partner applications, can easily publish the <br>Our vision is to standardize on a common data architecture that centers on <br>enabling LoBs, customers, and partners to easily produce and consume data <br>across application boundaries. <br>Data Management<br><br>Page 9:<br>7 | 21<br>North Star Architecture Strategy 2024<br>INTERNAL – SAP  Only<br>metadata describing available Data Products via <br>Open Resource Discovery  (ORD). As the ORD <br>aggregator, Unified Customer Landscape (UCL) <br>will serve as a Data Products Directory, enabling <br>applications and users to both find and discover <br>Data Products and access the metadata needed <br>to consume and understand them in a standard -<br>ized manner. The Datasphere Catalog will inte -<br>grate with UCL to facilitate consumption and inte -<br>gration of Data Products in Datasphere models. <br>SAP Business Accelerator Hub will add support <br>for Data Products as a resource type, showing all <br>Data Products available from SAP applications.<br>The Data Product concept is taken from data mesh <br>architectures, where each domain exposes data <br>products that others can consume. Data Products <br>are data sets that are exposed for consumption via <br>an API and enriched by metadata in form of an <br>ORD document describing the data product and <br>indicating where and how it can be accessed. Data <br>Products can be exposed directly from either an <br>application, a HANA Cloud instance, a HANA Data <br>Lake, or a Datasphere tenant. Moving forward, the <br>strategy is to expose all relevant data needed for <br>both data processing and analytics as Data <br>Products.<br>Customers and SAP also need to be able to com -<br>bine data from different applications. To do this, <br>two things are needed – the ability to uniquely <br>identify business objects in their system land -<br>scape and the ability to map the data semantics of <br>one application to those of another. For the for -<br>mer, applications need to expose data with ODM <br>IDs (OIDs) and for the latter, applications need to <br>expose data that complies with the ODM 2.0 rules <br>and guidelines . Instead of creating only new <br>aligned integration models, ODM 2.0 is designed <br>to extend existing APIs, Events, and Data Products. <br>ODM enables additional metadata to interconnect <br>data from various applications semantically. In due <br>course, most business objects exposed by Data <br>Products are expected to be ODM compliant.<br>Because the data is accessed for business trans -<br>actions or analytics, it is important to ensure that <br>SAP complies with the local data protection and <br>privacy laws. As more countries recognize the <br>importance of mature and secure Data Privacy <br>and Protection  (DPP) legislation to ensure their <br>sovereignty, covering the increasing complexity of <br>the different country-specific DPP requirements <br>and legislation is expected to become more chal -<br>lenging in the future. Our aim is to provide the high-<br>est standards for DPP across all SAP products and <br>provide a single access point to customers for DPP <br>information requests or information data access <br>reports for all products. The goal is to integrate <br>LoB-specific DPP solutions with the Data  Privacy <br>Integration Kernel Service in a federated approach <br>for the creation, processing, transfer, and destruc -<br>tion of personal data across application boundar -<br>ies. For more details on data processing based on <br>purpose, refer to the vision of the Working Group <br>“Data Protection and Privacy”.<br>In addition, it is important that all data manage -<br>ment stores be able to use customer-specific <br>encryption keys to encrypt relevant data at rest. <br>All applications and services must adopt these <br>capabilities. Customers may also opt in to manage <br>their encryption keys. The central key manage -<br>ment will be enabled through a kernel service that <br>integrates internally with SAP’s Data Custodian <br>Key Management Service for the customer-  <br>managed-keys scenario.<br>Data Management<br><br>Page 10:<br>8 | 21<br>North Star Architecture Strategy 2024<br>INTERNAL – SAP  Only<br>As of mid-2023, SAP developed more than <br>130 embedded AI scenarios. SAP projects can be <br>generally categorized into the following AI capabili-<br>ties: machine learning (ML), natural language pro -<br>cessing (NLP), conversational AI, computer vision, <br>and semantic technologies. SAP’s vision is to infuse <br>GenAI-powered innovations across all cloud busi -<br>ness applications and BTP, embed SAP’s Digital <br>Assistant (Joule) in all products, and build SAP-spe-<br>cific foundational models. Generative AI capabili -<br>ties will be offered to our partners and customers <br>to build and extend applications. For this purpose, <br>we will provide enterprise-grade qualities, includ -<br>ing data privacy and security. We will also support <br>the flexibility to adapt to the continuous emergence <br>of new use cases and the ongoing evolution of <br>GenAI technology.<br>For the conversational experience, SAP’s Digital <br>Assistant (Joule) will be embedded throughout <br>SAP’s cloud enterprise portfolio, delivering proac -<br>tive and contextualized insights from across the <br>breadth and depth of SAP solutions and third-party <br>sources. When building conversational capabilities <br>for our business software, we strongly recommend <br>integrating with Joule rather than starting from <br>scratch and/or leverage third-party solutions.<br>The large language model (LLM) market is highly <br>dynamic, and as new vendors enter the market and <br>open-source models become competitive, costs <br>are likely to go down and models will specialize. <br>Therefore, SAP will centrally contract, validate, and <br>provide access to LLMs from multiple vendors and <br>take care of many non-functional aspects such as <br>security or metering. For this, a generative AI hub <br>in AI Core will be provided to SAP business applica-<br>tions along with SAP tooling for infrastructure and <br>software development (e.g., code generation). LoBs <br>should use the generative AI hub to access <br>provided LLMs. For more information, refer to “Large <br>Language Model Access at SAP”.<br>LLMs come with a significant amount of knowledge, <br>but they do not contain information beyond the <br>original training data set, such as SAP-specific infor-<br>mation or customer-specific information that might <br>be relevant for a use case. To address this limita -<br>tion, business data, semantics, and metadata need <br>to be incorporated into an LLM request to ground <br>the LLM. To that end, the generative AI hub will pro-<br>vide capabilities to integrate with SAP’s data plat -<br>form. On top of that, SAP HANA Cloud will provide a <br>vector database capability for storing embeddings <br>and conducting efficient similarity searches. SAP <br>will adapt LLMs to its context and create its own dif-<br>ferentiated foundation model that incorporates <br>structured data and business process knowledge <br>with GPT/4HANA. In addition, KG/4HANA  will pro -<br>vide semantic context (e.g., via Knowledge Graphs) <br>to enable natural-language-based access and <br>knowledge-driven exploration of SAP data, as well <br>as to scale the training of foundation models.<br>SAP is committed to trustworthy and responsi -<br>ble AI, adhering to a rigorous AI Ethics policy that is <br>binding for all employees. The policy is continu -<br>ously updated in line with the UNESCO’s AI Ethics <br>recommendations. It is recommended that the <br>AI  Ethics Assessment Process be followed while <br>building use cases with AI features and functional -<br>ity. Prioritizing data protection and privacy, SAP <br>implements measures such as partner agreements <br>and legal intake processes and uses SAP-hosted <br>models.

We need to address this by putting <br>an even stronger focus on enabling a consistent <br>SaaS-like experience instead of forcing customers <br>into a PaaS-like (platform as a service) experience, <br>asking them to create and manage the technical <br>wiring between our applications (creating and <br>maintaining service instances, copying creden -<br>tials, etc.) on their own.<br>The foundation for delivering a cloud-like integra -<br>tion experience is to clearly separate technical and <br>business integration (see Beyond Zones). Techni-<br>cal integration refers to all tasks related to setting <br>up the technical wiring between applications and/<br>or services. This includes establishing trust (e.g., <br>by setting up mutual TLS or OAuth-based authen ti-<br>cation), the provisioning of integration services (e.g., <br>Kernel Services) or the application-specific config-<br>uration of connections. Business integration, on the <br>other hand, refers to all business-related integra -<br>tion decisions that the customer makes and mani -<br>fests by configuring such a business integration, <br>specifying the intent that different applications (or <br>tenants to be more specific) be integrated with each <br>other. These business integration decisions are fully <br>managed by the customer (customer-managed) as <br>they provide the needed flexibility for customers to <br>configure their business processes. All the required <br>underlying technical integrations, on the other hand, <br>need to be handled automatically by SAP, without <br>the customer even noticing (SAP-managed).<br>Taking this even further, we need to deliver smart <br>integration defaults and out-of-the-box automa -<br>tion wherever possible. For business integrations, <br>this means that customers get proposals that <br>match their business intent and landscape setup. <br>Preferably, these proposals are provided as part <br>of a central UI that facilitates provisioning, integra -<br>tion, and configuration in a harmonized experi -<br>ence. Customers can follow our proposals or <br>adjust them to their specific needs. A thorough <br>understanding of the as-is landscape (provided <br>via landscape introspection capabilities) and <br>architecture templates that model landscape <br>options (provided via architecture blueprints) form <br>the technical basis for smart defaults and the <br>underlying technical automation. Architecture <br>blueprints can be seen as executable reference <br>architectures that describe how applications and <br>services are combined into business solutions. <br>They are complemented with information about <br>the current landscape and are enriched with cus -<br>tomer input where required. The required land -<br>scape data is provided through Unified Landscape <br>Introspection (ULI) capabilities and is retrieved <br>from different source such as the Cloud Land -<br>scape Directory (CLD), Unified Customer Land -<br>scape (UCL), or Open Resource Discovery  (ORD) <br>for data on APIs and Events. The resulting solution <br>blueprint is the basis for a declarative description <br>of the target landscape, the so-called desired <br>state.<br>Many of the capabilities mentioned above (the <br>separation of customer-managed business and <br>SAP-managed technical integrations, automation <br>based on blueprints, etc.) are facilitated by the <br>Unified Services (Unified Provisioning, Unified <br>Offering a seamlessly integrated suite of products to our customers remains one <br>of our most important strategic aspirations and SAP’s unique selling proposition. <br>It is a fundamental prerequisite for being able to offer end-to-end business <br>processes and elevate cross-sell opportunities. <br>Integration<br><br>Page 13:<br>11 | 21<br>North Star Architecture Strategy 2024<br>INTERNAL – SAP  Only<br>Account, Unified Customer Landscape etc.). They <br>provide an LoB-agnostic set of services that eases <br>the integration of applications and services both <br>within SAP and for partner solutions. Unified Ser -<br>vices allow service providers to centrally register <br>their services as resources in a central repository <br>to be consumed by others – independent of where <br>and how the services are built. Depending on the <br>needs of the provider, not only can Unified Ser -<br>vices be used to orchestrate provisioning and inte-<br>gration, they can also address concerns like com -<br>mercialization or metering. It should be noted that <br>the objective is not to rip and replace existing <br>tools and services but to provide a central control <br>plane that glues together the puzzle pieces into a <br>coherent view. Inspired by Kubernetes, Unified <br>Services try to achieve this by implementing an <br>operator pattern, observing declarative requests <br>(the desired state), and acting to fulfill them (the <br>actual state). Instead of configuring technical <br>details imperatively on each singular customer <br>system, customers will be able to declare changes <br>to their systems at an abstract level that reflects <br>their business needs, while the required technical <br>and configuration changes will be automated and <br>managed by SAP and/or partners.<br>Apart from streamlining the setup of integrations, we <br>also strive for more guidance and best practices as <br>to which patterns should be used to develop inte -<br>grations across applications. Concrete use cases for <br>integrations include, for example, data distribution, <br>process integration, and side-by-side process <br>extensions. We aim to provide more guardrails for <br>all cases as to which patterns (e.g., request-driven <br>vs. event-driven) and technology should be used by <br>the development teams at SAP. As an example, for <br>master data we have an aligned target architecture <br>consisting of Master Data Integration (MDI) as the <br>service for replication, entity services as reuse ser-<br>vices, and the data architecture for analytical master <br>data consumption.<br>For services that are shared across different appli-<br>cation tenants, for example, MDI, Event Broker, Cen-<br>tral Entry Point (CEP), Task Center etc., semantics <br>and behavior of the tenant IDs currently need to be <br>aligned with the involved applications, leading to <br>inconsistencies, duplicate efforts, and disruption of <br>integration flows in case tenants are moved from <br>one data center to another. To overcome this, Global <br>Tenant ID (GTID) must be adopted as a common, <br>stable, and unique way to identify the tenants.<br>Integration<br><br>Page 14:<br>12 | 21<br>North Star Architecture Strategy 2024<br>INTERNAL – SAP  Only<br>SAP BTP consists of services, runtimes, and capa -<br>bilities that are contributed by various organizations <br>in SAP. Detailed information about the foundational <br>topics and technologies on SAP BTP’s way forward <br>during the next five years can be found in the 2023 <br>BTP Foundation Technology Strategy paper.<br>BTP is moving towards a service-centric <br>approach, and we bundle these services for cus -<br>tomer-facing offerings. To provide the core capa -<br>bilities of an ecosystem, BTP – as the foundation <br>of SAP’s Business SaaS offerings – is transforming <br>from the current runtime-centric approach toward <br>a multi-cloud, service-centric, and open ecosys -<br>tem. All BTP capabilities will be consumable inde -<br>pendent of the runtime used. We will also remove <br>dependencies on specific implementation details <br>of BTP services to reduce the architectural com -<br>plexity. By eliminating the need for service con -<br>sumers to comply with such implementation spe -<br>cifics of BTP-provided services, we will reduce the <br>current strong coupling among BTP services and <br>their consumers. That way we will be able to drive <br>the evolution of BTP more efficiently and to adapt <br>to changing requirements faster. Consumers will <br>also have more flexibility both when they are <br>building solutions on top of BTP, and when they <br>are just consuming individual services.<br>BTP currently acts as a virtual technical platform <br>provider across different hyperscalers and will be <br>available on SAP Converged Cloud in SAP data <br>centers as well. By means of Unified Services , SAP <br>BTP is also extending its capabilities toward pro -<br>viding a seamless integration into a harmonized, <br>yet flexible commercial and operational frame -<br>work. BTP can then be used more flexibly by any <br>solution as the platform to integrate into the SAP <br>ecosystem. It enables developers to leverage all <br>enterprise-grade BTP services, without the need <br>to adapt the solution architecture to the technical <br>concepts of BTP. In addition, BTP provides the <br>option to leverage hyperscaler or third-party ser -<br>vices. This provides a high degree of flexibility to <br>support evolutionary changes and quick time-to-<br>market options for applications and services. We <br>avoid the need for short-term implementations of <br>new and sometimes immature platform features, <br>which increase the risk of weakening the overall <br>enterprise qualities of BTP itself. In case of an <br>increasing demand, we still have the option to <br>implement requested new capabilities on BTP at a <br>later point in time. Thus, we can ensure that all SAP <br>quality criteria and the right level of maturity are <br>met. For SAP application and service develop -<br>ment teams, more guidance can be found in  <br> Working with Hyperscalers and PlusOne .<br>Enhancing the overall customer experience for <br>fully integrated business solutions when leverag -<br>ing multiple SAP solutions is part of the overall <br>SAP strategy. An essential part is providing a seam-<br>less SaaS experience for our customers – both <br>within our own portfolio and with partner solu -<br>tions. In addition to direct application-to-applica -<br>tion integration, BTP also supports the Integration <br>for SaaS scenario, where selected BTP services <br>provide integration technologies (Master Data <br>Integration, Event Broker, Task Center, etc.) for SAP <br>applications (see chapter “Integrations”).<br>We are also harmonizing the various concepts and <br>technologies that are currently used within SAP for <br>tenant provisioning and integration management. <br>The SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) provides the technical foundation <br>for our LoBs, customers, and partners. It is mission critical to SAP’s strategy as <br>documented in SAP’s Corporate Strategy 2023 paper. One of SAP’s strategic <br>priorities is to “Make our SAP BTP the platform for SAP and our ecosystem.”<br>Business Technology Platform<br><br>Page 15:<br>13 | 21<br>North Star Architecture Strategy 2024<br>INTERNAL – SAP  Only<br>Business Technology Platform<br>The goal is one holistic but flexible approach. The <br>existing BTP-specific subscription management <br>also evolves towards this one harmonized <br>approach. The target state is to provide technical <br>services and capabilities to holistically manage <br>application tenants and all related integrations <br>during their complete lifecycle and across all SAP <br>products and partner solutions, regardless of <br>whether these solutions are based on a BTP run -<br>time or not. These capabilities are based on the <br>fundamental architectural concepts of the Unified <br>Services as described in the “ Integrations” chap -<br>ter. Consequently, we need to smoothly evolve the <br>BTP multi-tenancy approach and untangle vari-<br>ous orthogonal aspects (tenant, region, trust, secu-<br>rity, commercial, etc.) that are currently tightly cou-<br>pled to the concept of a local BTP subaccount.<br>In parallel to the automated provisioning and inte -<br>gration lifecycle management, the appropriate level <br>of control is provided to customers, allowing them <br>to adapt the configuration to their business-specific <br>needs. This approach allows SAP customers to <br>focus on their core business operations while we <br>handle the technical aspects of their applications <br>and integration. We ensure flexibility without the <br>need for customers to understand or work with BTP <br>PaaS concepts like subaccounts or runtimes when <br>they are configuring and managing their SAP solu -<br>tions and the related integrations. This harmoniza -<br>tion also strives to deliver automated orchestration <br>of the customer system landscape and the <br>related integrations. At any time, customers will <br>be able to get an overview of their actual land -<br>scape, including BTP-based applications, BTP-<br>external LoB solutions, connected on-prem solu -<br>tions, partner solutions, registered third-party <br>systems, and the related integrations. All landscape <br>information will be accessible via the Unified Land-<br>scape Introspection based on Unified Metadata <br>Service (UMS) as machine-readable data, so that <br>applications can smartly react to changes and <br>extensions of the customer’s system landscape.<br>A vibrant partner ecosystem around SAP’s cloud <br>offerings has been desired for a long time. With <br>Unified Services being part of BTP, we will provide <br>the technical foundation for an open SAP ecosys -<br>tem. Functionality like seamless integration into <br>the SAP marketplace or leveraging fully managed <br>metering and billing infrastructure will not only be <br>available SAP internally, it will also be offered to <br>partners to build a vital and growing ecosystem <br>around SAP’s core business solutions. For part -<br>ners and independent software vendors (ISVs), we <br>will lower the entry barrier by providing more guid-<br>ance, frameworks, and tools.

This allows all non-BTP SAP appli-<br>cations and partner solutions to leverage them as <br>well. When fully leveraging BTP as the platform for <br>developing and hosting a business solution, inte -<br>gration into the SAP ecosystem is provided out-of-<br>the-box without any additional effort. Business <br>solutions that do not use BTP PaaS capabilities can <br>still benefit from BTP by consuming any of the BTP-<br>provided services.

It’s important that services that are <br>offered for cross-consumption be remotely acces-<br>sible from any infrastructure region, especially the <br>CAT-2 and CAT-3 services. This includes, but is not <br>limited to, decoupling from the current BTP subac-<br>count, ensuring that the service supports authenti -<br>cation with SSO, integrated audit logs, ready-to-<br>use tenant setups, compliance with regulatory <br>requirements, etc.<br>To react faster to growing customer demands, SAP <br>also needs to provide more flexibility regarding <br>the presence of our products (including BTP) in <br>new regions and markets. For BTP and its related <br>services, this is planned to be achieved via <br> satellites and ground stations. Ground stations are <br>infrastructure regions with a CloudFoundry land -<br>scape and a BTP Region local control plane. Satel-<br>lites are a group of services deployed into an infra-<br>structure region where no BTP ground station is <br>present. With this approach, we expect to cover <br>both the legal obligations for data residency and <br>data protection and privacy in the respective <br>regions. It complements the 4+1 strategy and opti-<br>mizes the SAP-wide global rollout. Multi-provider <br>portability to avoid expensive vendor lock-in situ -<br>ation can be achieved by applying a combination <br>of SAP and hyperscaler technology (e.g., utilizing <br>SAP Gardener for infrastructure abstraction, utiliz -<br>ing BTP services, building a strategy for native ser -<br>vice substitution with equivalent BTP services, <br>etc.). SAP PlusOne is of strategic importance to <br>SAP. It gives us a strategic alternative in case geo-<br>political, customer demand and competitive offer -<br>ings requires SAP to reconsider previously sup -<br>ported infrastructure choices. When developing a <br>new public cloud solution, using PlusOne as Infra -<br>structure as a Service (IaaS) and BTP as PaaS is <br>recommended. Any major changes/additions to <br>the infrastructure need to be discussed and jointly <br>agreed upon with the Cloud Delivery Board .

Thus, we need a central <br>endpoint for managing authentication, user man -<br>agement, and authorization assignments within all <br>SAP applications that must also support the SaaS <br>experience of BTP. SAP Cloud Identity services  <br>(SCI) are the key enabler for that. While some cus -<br>tomers expect an end-to-end IAM solution from <br>SAP, SCI will only be sufficient for rather simple <br>cases, and we will not invest in building an end-to-<br>end solution but refer to partners to complement <br>SCI.<br>The integration of third-party IAM solutions must <br>be based on open standards.

SAP Universal ID integration).<br>While the customer’s identity provider is used for <br>end user authentication ( TG02.R1), we need a sin -<br>gle token issuer at SAP to enable the principal <br>propagation across all components within the SAP <br>ecosystem, removing the current need for point-<br>to-point trust setups ( TG02.R5). As the SAP eco -<br>system includes cross-identity consumption sce -<br>narios, this token service must be able to bridge <br>the SAP identity domain with other identity <br>domains, e.g., with Azure Active Directory for <br>Microsoft Teams integration.<br>For service-to-service communication (especially <br>SAP-to-SAP), we will introduce cross-platform <br>automated distribution of service identities <br>(especially SAP Cloud Root CA-based) and the <br>rotation of the relevant keys.

However, this only happens if some foun -<br>dational requirements are met. SaaS solutions <br>across the industry usually come with a service <br>level agreement (SLA) of around 99.9XX% <br> availability. To illustrate this further, an SLA of <br>99.99% translates to unavailability of a system for <br>8.6 seconds daily, 1:48 mins weekly, 4:21 mins <br>monthly, 13:2.4 mins quarterly, or 52:9.8 mins <br>yearly. To achieve such a level of resiliency, appli -<br>cations and services need to safeguard against <br>unplanned downtimes by avoiding single points of <br>failure, introducing redundancy, and reducing <br>dependencies. Defects must be detected as early <br>as possible in the development lifecycle, e.g., by <br>automated test strategies. Planned downtimes <br>must be restricted and concepts need to be put in <br>place to avoid such downtimes in case of upgrades <br>and updates. At the same time, measures towards <br>resiliency must not limit our speed of innovation <br>and our ability to deliver new code at a rapid pace <br>without fear of regression or unplanned outages. <br>Consequently, concepts such as controlled <br>release of new behavior via phased rollout and <br>feature toggles must be leveraged.<br>One key aspect of a SaaS solution is elasticity.  <br>SaaS solutions need to scale up, scale down, <br>SaaS solutions need to be secure, reliable, scalable, and cost-optimized.  <br>This is enabled by providing clear direction on product architecture, ensuring <br>a holistic, efficient global use of our 4+1 infrastructure. <br>Cloud Delivery and Operations<br>scale-in, or scale-out automatically based on the <br>current load situation.

It is recommended <br>that costs be monitored regularly for resource uti -<br>lization and service plans, in addition to designing <br>for cost efficiency. This is a circular process with <br>applications being redesigned, resized, recalcu -<br>lated, and continuously optimized.<br>Running SaaS solutions also leads to responsibil -<br>ity for observing the same.

To enable the exposure, ingestion, routing & <br>processing, and consumption of cross-LoB end-<br>to-end telemetry signals, Open Telemetry  (OTLP) <br>is the chosen SAP-wide standard that needs to be <br>followed. Applications can continue using their <br>existing telemetry mechanisms and integrate the <br>current telemetry signals using the Open Teleme -<br>try Collectors. Refer to the CPA ADRs for formats <br>and protocols of Metrics , Trace Correlation , and <br>Logs. With OTLP established as the common stan -<br>dard for telemetry signals and a cross-LoB routing <br>and processing service available, the producers of <br>telemetry signals can be decoupled from poten -<br>tial consumers and access and consumption of <br>telemetry signals can be standardized. The focus <br>can then be on the data necessary for different <br>monitoring use cases rather than on individual, <br>often proprietary, point-to-point integrations to <br>ingest them.

With standardization of log -<br>ging, monitoring, and tracing mechanisms, more <br>automated healing mechanisms can also be <br>deployed. The overall result is a much better cus -<br>tomer experience, less costs, vendor neutrality, <br>better alerting, and faster resolution of customer <br>issues.<br>In addition to business-application-specific log -<br>ging, all business applications and cloud services <br>that are offered to customers and/or process cus -<br>tomer data must ensure active application and <br>security event logging. Products and services must <br>integrate their security event logs into the SAP cor-<br>porate SIEM (Security Incident and Event Man-<br>agement) central services. The integrity of the <br>logs must be protected from unauthorized change, <br>continuously monitored, and reviewed. It is the <br>responsibility of the application and service owner <br>to ensure that logs are generated and at least tem-<br>porarily stored on the IT assets until collected by <br>the central SIEM infrastructure, if not transported <br>to SIEM directly. Refer to the SAP Threat Detection <br>and Response Management Standard for more <br>details about minimum log requirements. Also <br>refer to the product standard requirement <br> SEC-215: Log security relevant events.<br>Another key aspect of secure cloud delivery is the <br>Zero Trust Network.  In addition to the public <br>cloud applications, SAP also has many internal <br>backend applications where security is equally <br>important. It needs to be ensured that different <br>use cases run on dedicated landscapes, support <br>encrypted communication, and any API calls are <br>access-limited with authentication and authoriza -<br>tion with SAP approved identity providers as <br>described in “ Authentication, Authorization, and <br>Identity Lifecycle Management ”. In addition, <br>access privileges to the cloud production <br>infrastructure, such as IaaS resources and sys -<br>tems, need to be controlled via central access ser-<br>vices in accordance with the security product <br> standard. In line with Zero Trust principles and to <br>control access to cloud resources, the central <br>access services enable admins and operators with <br>a standardized and secure E2E access path to <br>cloud infrastructure resources. For example: An <br>administrator with privileged access to systems for <br>patching or troubleshooting or an operator for <br>configuration of network policies is authorized to <br>access cloud infrastructure resources if the central <br>access system controls a secure authentication, <br>checks for a healthy device posture, and manages <br>access.<br>A key aspect of a Zero Trust architecture is Key & <br>Secret Management.  SAP systems that deploy <br>or maintain access to other systems via machine-<br>usable keys, credentials, or secrets should ensure <br>that these are encrypted in the SAP business <br>applications. In addition, credentials must not be <br>hardcoded into the application or stored in source <br>code. Instead, using a secure vault or credential <br>store is required. Also, keys and secrets must com-<br>ply with the corporate security requirements – key <br>length, algorithms, retention, key rotation, etc.<br>SAP needs to deliver its software consistently, <br>automatically, and frequently. Open Component <br>Model is a building block in the delivery toolset. <br>Using one aligned software component model for <br>every LoB is recommended, whereas for services <br>owned by BTP its use is mandatory. Further, clear <br>Asset Management and Ownership  needs to <br>be provided for all SAP assets, artifacts, and ser -<br>vices deployed into the cloud. Such resources <br>must be maintained and kept up- to-date in the <br>Central Configuration Item Repository (CCIR). This <br>includes proper mapping into the SAP organiza -<br>tional structure and cost center metrics. Owner -<br>less accounts, resources, and services must be <br>deactivated and finally securely deleted (garbage <br>collection).<br>Cloud Delivery and Operations<br><br>Page 23:<br>21 | 21<br>North Star Architecture Strategy 2024<br>INTERNAL – SAP  Only<br>Localization is a well-understood topic inside SAP, <br>requiring just the right level of execution across <br>the lifespan of any SAP solution, to enable our cus-<br>tomers to focus on sustainable business practices <br>and market growth across the globe. The other <br>four priorities define the prevailing vectors from <br>which the direction of the North Star is derived.<br>The nine overarching topic areas covered in this <br>North Star document describe the various archi -<br>tectural aspects that need to be addressed when <br>following our corporate strategy and delivering on <br>our SAP mission. There are many important details <br>or even larger aspects that cannot be covered in <br>such a strategy document. However, you will find <br>that most of these are discussed and driven in one <br>of the workstreams within the Cross-Product Archi-<br>tecture working groups.<br>The Cross-Product Architecture is continuously <br>evolving to adapt to the technical evolution around <br>us, but also to constantly improve efficiency and <br>As defined in the deep dive section of SAP’s Corporate Strategy 2023,  <br>the five cross priorities for all of us are Integration, Embedded AI, Next-Gen UX, <br>Cloud Operational Excellence, and Localization. <br>A Final Word<br>the overall user experience, and to cover new <br>requirements. It is therefore essential that you <br>make use of the various existing communication <br>channels of CPA to keep yourself up to date about <br>Cross Product Architecture topics (see Participat -<br>ing in CPA).<br>Sometimes changes or new architectural concepts <br>have a significant impact on the existing codebase <br>and consequently require a certain investment to <br>adapt to these concepts. On the other hand, if the <br>overall value for SAP and for our customers is big -<br>ger than the investment, these efforts will always <br>pay off over time.<br>And finally, technical evolutions should not lead to <br>disruptions for customers regarding user experi -<br>ence or any needed migration. It should be one of <br>our mantras that every technical evolution we <br>drive, independent of its complexity, will be a <br>smooth evolution for our existing customers, but <br>probably a revolution for any new SAP customer.</div>
