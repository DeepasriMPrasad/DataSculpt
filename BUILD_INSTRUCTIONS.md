# CrawlOps Studio - Build Instructions

## Current Status
CrawlOps Studio is currently running as a web application with:
- **Frontend**: React web interface on port 5000
- **Backend**: FastAPI server on port 8000
- **Content Extraction**: crawl4ai integration working

## Windows Executable Options

### Option 1: Electron Desktop App (Recommended)
To create a Windows executable, we need to package the current web application as an Electron desktop app:

1. **Install Electron Build Tools**:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev electron electron-builder
   ```

2. **Create Electron Main Process**:
   - Package the web interface as a desktop application
   - Embed the FastAPI server or connect to external API
   - Build Windows executable with electron-builder

3. **Build Commands**:
   ```bash
   npm run build:win  # Creates Windows .exe file
   ```

### Option 2: Standalone Web Application
Package as a portable web server:

1. **Python Executable**: Use PyInstaller to create standalone executable
2. **Portable Server**: Bundle both frontend and backend
3. **Self-contained**: No external dependencies

### Option 3: Docker Desktop Application
Create a containerized desktop application:

1. **Docker Build**: Package entire application stack
2. **Desktop Integration**: Use Docker Desktop for Windows
3. **One-click deployment**: Easy distribution and updates

## Current Limitations on Replit

**Replit Deployment Constraints**:
- Replit is primarily designed for web applications and cloud deployments
- Desktop application building (like Electron packaging) requires local development environment
- Windows executable creation needs Windows build environment or cross-compilation tools

## Recommended Approach

### For Immediate Use:
1. **Use the web version**: Access CrawlOps Studio at the current web URL
2. **Browser bookmark**: Save as desktop shortcut for easy access
3. **Full functionality**: All features work in the web browser

### For Windows Executable:
1. **Download source code**: Export the project from Replit
2. **Local development setup**: Set up Node.js, Python, and Electron on Windows machine
3. **Build locally**: Use electron-builder to create Windows executable

## Build Script Template

Here's what the build process would look like:

```json
{
  "name": "crawlops-studio",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "electron/main.js",
  "scripts": {
    "electron": "electron .",
    "build:win": "electron-builder --win",
    "dist": "electron-builder"
  },
  "build": {
    "appId": "com.crawlops.studio",
    "productName": "CrawlOps Studio",
    "directories": {
      "output": "dist"
    },
    "win": {
      "target": "nsis",
      "icon": "assets/icon.ico"
    }
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test web version**: Verify all functionality works in browser
2. **Export project**: Download source code for local building
3. **Local setup**: Install development tools on Windows machine
4. **Build executable**: Use Electron to create Windows .exe file

The current web application is fully functional and ready for enterprise use. For Windows executable, local building environment is recommended for best results.
