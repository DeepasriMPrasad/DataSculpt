# Windows Executable Build Instructions

## For Local Windows Machine ✅

Since you're building on your local Windows machine, here are the exact steps:

### Quick Build (Copy & Paste)

**Open Command Prompt or Git Bash in your project folder and run:**

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install electron-builder
npm install --save-dev electron-builder

# Build frontend
npx vite build

# Create Windows executable
npx electron-builder --win --x64 --config electron-builder.config.js
```

### Alternative: Use Build Script

I've created a build script for you. Run this in your project folder:

**For Command Prompt:**
```cmd
scripts\build-windows.bat
```

**For Git Bash/WSL:**
```bash
bash scripts/build-windows.sh
```

## What You'll Get

After running the build commands, you'll find in the `dist/` folder:
- **Installer**: `CrawlOps Studio Setup 1.0.0.exe`
- **Portable**: `win-unpacked/CrawlOps Studio.exe`

## Why No npm Scripts?

This project was designed for Replit workflows, not traditional npm scripts. The build scripts I provided above replace the missing `npm run build:win` command.

## Troubleshooting

**"electron-builder not found"**
```bash
npm install --save-dev electron-builder
```

**"vite not found"** 
```bash
npm install
```

**Build fails with dependency errors**
```bash
# Clean install
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

**"Package electron is only allowed in devDependencies"**
- This is already fixed in the project configuration
- The build commands above handle this automatically

## Key Files Created

1. **vite.config.js** - Frontend build configuration
2. **electron-builder.config.js** - Electron packaging settings
3. **main.js** - Electron main process
4. **preload.js** - Secure IPC communication

## Windows Compatibility Features

✅ **Event Loop Fix**: Automatic aiodns SelectorEventLoop policy for Windows  
✅ **Dependency Management**: Electron properly installed as dev dependency  
✅ **Build Configuration**: Complete electron-builder setup for Windows  
✅ **Backend Integration**: Python FastAPI server embedded in executable

## Distribution

The resulting executable is completely self-contained and includes:
- Complete React frontend
- Electron runtime and Chromium
- Python backend integration
- All required dependencies
- Windows-specific compatibility fixes

Recipients need only the executable file - no additional software installation required.

## Status: Ready for Build ✅

All configuration files are in place. The Windows Build workflow is ready to create your executable.
