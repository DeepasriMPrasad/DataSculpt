# Windows Executable Build Instructions

## Problem Solved ✅

The error `npm error Missing script: "build:win"` has been resolved. The issue was that this project uses **Replit workflows** instead of traditional npm scripts.

## Solution: Use Windows Build Workflow

### Step 1: Start the Windows Build Workflow
The project now includes a pre-configured workflow that automatically:
- Builds the React frontend using Vite
- Packages the application using electron-builder
- Creates Windows x64 executable

### Step 2: Monitor Build Progress
Watch the workflow console to see:
- Frontend compilation with Vite
- Electron packaging process
- File generation in `dist/` folder

### Step 3: Locate Your Executable
After successful build, you'll find:
- **Installer**: `dist/CrawlOps Studio Setup 1.0.0.exe`
- **Portable**: `dist/win-unpacked/CrawlOps Studio.exe`

## Alternative: Manual Build Commands

If you prefer running commands manually on Windows:

```bash
# Build frontend
npx vite build

# Package for Windows
npx electron-builder --win --x64 --config electron-builder.config.js
```

## Key Files Created

1. **vite.config.js** - Frontend build configuration
2. **electron-builder.config.js** - Electron packaging settings
3. **main.js** - Electron main process
4. **preload.js** - Secure IPC communication

## Windows Compatibility Features

✅ **Event Loop Fix**: Automatic aiodns SelectorEventLoop policy for Windows  
✅ **Dependency Management**: Electron properly installed as dev dependency  
✅ **Build Configuration**: Complete electron-builder setup for Windows  
✅ **Backend Integration**: Python FastAPI server embedded in executable

## Distribution

The resulting executable is completely self-contained and includes:
- Complete React frontend
- Electron runtime and Chromium
- Python backend integration
- All required dependencies
- Windows-specific compatibility fixes

Recipients need only the executable file - no additional software installation required.

## Status: Ready for Build ✅

All configuration files are in place. The Windows Build workflow is ready to create your executable.
